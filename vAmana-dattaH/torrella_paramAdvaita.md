A Vaiṣṇava Paramādvaita in 10th-Century
Kashmir?
The Work of Vāmanadatta
RAFFAELE TORELLA

Bhāgavatotpala, more widely known in Kashmir under the name Utpalavaiṣṇava,[^1] scattered his commentary on the Spandakārikā (Spandapradīpikā, henceforth SpPr) with often striking quotations from a work entitled Saṃvitprakāśa (henceforth SP), sometimes paired with another work entitled Ātmasaptati, their tone and content looking closely related to each other. 

If we know the name of author, which neither Bhāgavatotpala nor later authors ever mentioned, we owe it to Jayaratha, the diligent commentator of Abhinavagupta’s Tantrāloka (henceforth TĀ). TĀ 5.154cd-155ab reads: 

> nīle pīte sukhe duḥkhe  
> citsvarūpam akhaṇḍitam |  
> gurubhir bhāṣitaṃ tasmād  
> upāyeṣu vicitratā || 
> 
> In blue, yellow, pleasure and pain the very nature of consciousness remains undivided: this has been said by the master. 

Therefore, there is diversity as regards the means [only]. “By the master,” Jayaratha says in his commentary (vol. III, p. 467), “namely by Vāmanadattācārya in the SP.”+++(5)+++ 


[^1]: In the two printed editions of the SpPr (both not fully reliable) by Gopinātha Kavirāja and M. S. G. Dyczkowski, the name in the colophon is given as Bhagavatotpala and Bhagavadutpala, respectively. What most probably is the correct form (Bhāgavatotpala) is found in the colophon of two mss. of the SpPr in the Research Library, Srinagar (No. 861, raciteyaṃ bhāgavatotpalena; No. 829, ity ācāryabhāgavato-utpalaviracitā). These mss. belong to a group of four. śāradā mss. of the SpPr which have not been used for the above editions (No. 2233 has ity ācāryotpalaviracitā; No. 994 ends abruptly while commenting on śloka 31).


This passage is not found in the mss. of the SP (see below), but we can still give credit to Jayaratha’s attribution, since the śloka, this time in full, is quoted in SpPr p. 18 (Dyczkowski ed.) as belonging to the SP,  
and moreover it recurs unchanged in the Lakṣmītantra (henceforth LT),  
which incorporates many verses from the SP (see below).  
The colophons of the Ātmasaptati and the other four Prakaraṇas which follow the SP in the extant mss. also mention his name as the author.  
Vāmanadatta most probably lived around the middle of 10th century.  
The earliest authors to quote from him are the aforementioned Bhāgavatotpala, and Nārāyaṇakaṇṭha in the Mṛgendravṛtti (see below).  
Bhāgavatotpala, who quotes Utpaladeva (the Īśvarapratyabhijñākārikā, henceforth ĪPK)[^2] but not Abhinavagupta,  
probably belongs to the second half of the 10th century.  
Nārāyaṇakaṇṭha belongs approximately to the same period,  
given that he also quotes Utpaladeva (the Īśvarasiddhi) [^3] and that his son Rāmakaṇṭha is quoted by Abhinavagupta[^4] (and Kṣemarāja – he is the kairaṇavyākhyātṛ referred to in the Svacchandoddyota, vol. I, p. 322).  
The colophons of the SP and the other Prakaraṇas indicate that Vāmanadatta is from Kashmir and a brahmin,  
and they introduce us to his particular doctrinal position: 

> ekāyane prasūtasya  
> kaśmīreṣu dvijātmanaḥ |  
kṛtir vāmanadattasya... ||  

The mention of the Ekāyana testifies to Vāmanadatta’s affiliation to the Pāñcarātra. The followers of the Pāñcarātra refer to one Ekāyanaveda which they consider the essence and primordial source of the four Vedas and also call “secret tradition” (Īśvarasaṃhitā 21.531: ādyam ekāyanaṃ vedaṃ rahasyāmnāyasaṃjñitam). 

The lost Kāśmirāgamaprāmāṇya of Yāmuna, according to what the author himself says in his main work, the Āgamaprāmāṇya (p. 79), dealt with the non-human nature of the Ekāyana-branch.  
In another passage of the Āgamaprāmāṇya (p. 40) Yāmuna points out that the Ekāyanaśākhins upheld – against the śaivas – the birth, i.e. the limited nature, of Rudra.+++(4)+++ 

By crossing the references given in the Haravijaya and the Nareśvaraparīkṣā (SANDERSON 2009, pp. 107- 108), we have in Kashmir two subdivisions of Pāñcarātra: Ekāyanas and followers of Saṁkarṣaṇaśāstra, corresponding to Saṁhitā Pāñcarātra and Saṁkarṣaṇa Pāñcarātra, respectively.

[^4]: For a thorough assessment of Rāmakaṇṭha’s date see GOODALL 1998, pp. xiiixviii.


[[427]]

However, a later Saṁhitā, the Pārameśvarasaṃhitā, links the Ekāyanaveda with Saṁkarṣaṇa (CZERNIAK-DROĵDĵOWICZ forthcoming),  
the Ekāyanas receiving the appellation of Āgamasiddhāntins,  
against the Vaidika termed Mantrasiddhāntins.[^5]  
According to the Pādmasaṃhitā, the Ekāyanas are a very special kind of Bhāgavatas:  
they do not need initiation into Pāñcarātra, being so to speak born Pāñcarātrins (CZERNIAK-DROĵDĵOWICZ forthcoming).+++(5)+++  
The presence of Vaiṣṇavism in Kashmir from early times is extensively documented by archeological and literary evidence,[^6]  
just as it seems probable that some of the Pāñcarātra Saṁhitās (cited apparently for the first time in the SpPr) were elaborated in Kashmir.  
Indeed, the SP is a stuti dedicated to Viṣṇu,  
and in it and the other Prakaraṇas several doctrinal references that are peculiar to the Pāñcarātra can be found,  
such as, for instance, the doctrine of the vyūhas in Prakaraṇa [^4].  

However, as we shall see,  
this is a Pāñcarātra interpreted in a strictly non-dualistic sense,  
which makes it fully consonant with the contemporary schools of non-dual śaivism.  
Many śaiva masters do not hesitate to quote Vāmanadatta’s work as an authority  
alongside other authoritative purely śaiva texts and to support śaiva doctrines.+++(5)+++  
This gives the impression that the adhesion to a certain spiritual climate in the Kashmir of the time  
represented such a strong element of affinity, at the most elevated levels,  
that it succeeded in overcoming sectarian and doctrinal differences.  

One may also quote another example, that of Bhaṭṭa Divākaravatsa,  
belonging approximately to the same period (SANDERSON 2007, p. 255), and author of two works, the Kakṣyāstotra and the Vivekāñjana, which are quoted as authorities by śaiva authors, like Abhinavagupta and Kṣemarāja, despite their Pāñcarātra contents.  
This may appear all the more surprising  
when one thinks that the relations between śaivas and Vaiṣṇavas had often been –  
and were to become even more so in the future –  
such as to cast a shadow over the alleged tolerance of Hinduism (cf. DASGUPTA 1932, p. 18; GONDA 1970, pp. 93-94).+++(4)+++  

[^5]: On Āgamasiddhānta and Mantrasiddhānta (plus Tantra° and Tantrāntara°), see RASTELLI 2003.
[^6]: The relevant passages from the Rājataraṅgiṇī have been collected and studied in RAI 1955, pp. 188-194. See SANDERSON 2009a, pp. 58-70; 2009b, pp. 107-109.


Even when coexistence is, after all, peaceful, as in the Kashmir of the time,  
śaivas and Vaiṣṇavas do not go beyond a generic acknowledgement of the limited and provisional truth of the other,  
which is only admitted if subordinated to the absolute truth represented by one’s own creed.  
This is particularly evident in the Vaiṣṇavas, who are much more oriented than the śaivas towards the ekāntavāda (cf. GONDA 1970, p. 93).  
Anyhow, we see that in India even when one religious community accepts the partial truth of another,  
the delimitation between the respective authoritative texts tends to remain rigid.+++(5)+++  
śaivas and Pāñcarātrins are no exception to this.  
In criticizing the validity of the scriptures belonging to the Pāśupatas, Kālamukhas, Kāpālikas and śaivas (Āgamaprāmāṇya p. 44), Yāmuna says: 

> As the authoritativeness of these Tantras is already vitiated by their mutual contradictions,  
> it is not really necessary for them to be rejected with the stick of the Veda. [...]  
> Let it not be said, how could Rudra, who is very trustworthy,  
> promulgate such a vast collection of texts which are not authoritative ? [...]  
> Or else one may reason that since Rudra may have composed such a system  
> for the purpose of deceiving the world because he is known as a promulgator of deceitful doctrines,  
> it is not even necessary to assume error on his part.  
> (Transl. BUITENEN 1971, p. 71.) 

It is known, on the other hand, that Kṣemarāja in the Pratyabhijñāhṛdaya relegates the Pāñcarātra  
to a very humble position on the scale of principles.[^7]  

The figure of Vāmanadatta does not have any place in the later Vaiṣṇava tradition,  
in which sectarian elements tend to prevail.  
He survives only indirectly since several stanzas of the SP are found to be incorporated or paraphrased in the LT (particularly in Chapter 14),  
a relatively late and eclectic text,+++(5)+++  
which only begins to be considered an authority from the time of Vedāntadeśika onwards (GUPTA 1972, p. xx).[^8]  

[^7]: 

    See p. 17:  
    > parā prakṛtir bhagavān vāsudevaḥ,  
    tad-visphuliṅga-prāyā eva jīvāḥ  
    iti pāñcarātrāḥ.  
    parasyāḥ prakṛteḥ pariṇāmābhyupagamād  
    avyakte evābhiniviṣṭāḥ.  
    
    This does not prevent Maheśvarānanda from quoting as an authority a Pāñcarātra scripture like the LT (see below), most probably due to the emphasis this text places on the Goddess.

[^8]: Some verses of the LT are cited in the Mahārthamañjarīparimala (henceforth MPP): 14.5cd-6, cit. p. 65; 22.7ab, cit. p. 175. The probable date of Maheśvarānanda is very close to Vedāntadeśika’s (around the beginning of the 14th c.; cf. SANDERSON 2007, p. 412).+++(5)+++



[[429]]

Bhāgavatotpala, an author whose doctrinal and religious affiliation is very close to Vāmanadatta’s (and Pāñcarātra’s),[^9] and who quotes him so frequently,  
aims to illuminate and support the doctrine of the Spanda with an equal share of Vaiṣṇava and śaiva authorities.  
He cites (p. 12) two passages, from a śaiva and a Pāñcarātrin work, now both lost,  
that indicate the existence of a tolerant and all-comprehensive stratum of the two opposing schools  
that recognised each other as being united in non-duality.

The Pāñcarātra text, the Māyāvāmanasaṃhitā, reads:

> viṣṇu-śiva-sūrya-buddhādi-rūpatayā  
tat-tac-chakti-cakra-parivāra-yutas  
tat-kāraṇaṃ bhagavān eka eva  
dhyāna-bhedenopāsyatvenābhihitaḥ.+++(5)+++

> In the form of Viṣṇu, śiva, Sūrya, Buddha etc. and accompanied by the
retinue of the various powers of which he is the sole cause, one is the Blessed One,  
variously named depending on the different kinds of meditation and the diverse rites.

And the śaiva text, the Kulayukti:

> vedānte vaiṣṇave śaive  
saure bauddhe ’nyato ’pi ca |  
eka eva paraḥ svātmā  
jñātā jñeyaṃ maheśvari ||

> In Vedānta, in Viṣṇuism, in śaivism, in the Saura sect, in Buddhism and so on, one is the supreme, the own self, the knower and the knowable, O Maheśvarī.[^10]


[^9]: Quite unconvincingly, DYCZKOWSKI 1992 argues (p. 28) that Bhāgavatotpala was in fact a śaiva as shown by his referring to śiva as his abhimatadevatā(SpPr, p. 7). It is instead clear from the context that by saying so Bhāgavatotpala is referring to the author of the Spandakārikā, not to himself. Then, the first part of his very name (Bhāgavata) leaves no doubt about his religious affiliation.


No mention of Vāmanadatta and his works (or of Bhāgavatotpala) is to be found in the extant works of Yāmuna,  
the first great systemizer and defender of the Pāñcarātra tradition,  
who must have lived a little later than Vāmanadatta (we must however take into account that his Kāśmīrāgamaprāmāṇya has not come down to us);  
nor is it in Vedāntadeśika or in Rāmānuja.  
The later Pāñcarātra tradition, once it firmly turned towards the viśiṣṭādvaita,  
erased the memory not only of Vāmanadatta, 
but also of a whole series of Vaiṣṇava texts apparently grounded on non-duality,  
whose existence is testified by Bhāgavatotpala’s quotations,  
for instance the Jñānasaṃbodha, the Jābalīsūtra, the ṣāḍguṇyaviveka and others.



[^10]: 

    A verse from the SP (not extant in the mss.) cited in SpPr, p. 27 states that there is no difference between the qualities of śiva and Viṣṇu 

    > (bhedaḥ sarvajñatādīnāṃ  
    jñānādīnāṃ ca nāsty amī |  
    jñānasyaiva dharmatayā  
    cidrūpasya sthitir yataḥ ||).


Vāmanadatta’s teaching, on the contrary, was held in great respect by the śaiva authors.  
Primarily by those who belonged to the great and variegated non-dual tradition, but not by them alone; in fact,  
the first śaiva to quote him is the siddhāntin Nārāyaṇakaṇṭha,  
who in the above-mentioned passage (Mṛgendravṛtti, vidyāpāda, p.153) quotes with approval,  
without citing the author or the title,  
two verses belonging to Prakaraṇa 2 (6, 56).  
The first of these two verses is also quoted in the chapter of the Sarvadarśanasaṃgraha on the śaivadarśana,  
but in order to forestall drawing the mistaken conclusion that the Ātmasaptati was known to Mādhava,  
it must be said, as I have shown elsewhere (TORELLA 1979),  
that the chapter on the śaivadarśana is not much more than a clever collage of passages that Mādhava has taken from Nārāyaṇakaṇṭha’s Mṛgendravṛtti and Aghoraśiva’s Tattvaprakāśavṛtti.


The author who most extensively quotes from Vāmanadatta’s works is Bhāgavatotpala.  
The total number of verses quoted is 42,[^11] and they are all to be found in Prakaraṇa 1 (the SP), with the exception of six (five belonging to Prakaraṇa 2 and one to Prakaraṇa 5).  
Another literal quotation, this time from Prakaraṇa 2 (v. 30), can be found in Abhinavagupta’s Parātrīśikāvivaraṇa (p. 214); a passage of his Tantrasāra (henceforth TS) may contain a reminiscence of a verse of SP.[^12] 

Other quotations from Vāmanadatta’s Prakaraṇas are found in Maheśvarānanda’s MMP,[^13] śivopādhyāya’s Vijñānabhairavoddyota, [^14] Kṣemarāja’s Stavacintāmaṇivivṛti[^15] and Bhāskarakaṇṭha’s commentary on the Īśvarapratyabhijñāvimarśinī.[^16]

[[431]]

The passage from the TĀ cited above permits us to touch on another question to which, however, it is not possible to obtain a definite answer, namely whether Abhinavagupta had been a disciple of
Vāmanadatta.  
The fact that Abhinavagupta calls him gurubhiḥ is not cogent in itself, since the term may have been used in a generic sense.

Of the SP and the other Prakaraṇas only three mss. have come down to us,[^17] all of them incomplete. Two printed editions are available (only based on mss. A and B), one by M. Dyczkowski and one by Bh. P. Tripathi, both of them quite problematic with respect to the reading of the mss. and the emendations proposed.[^18]

As we have seen, the work is divided into Prakaraṇas.  
SP is the title of the first one[^19] and was later extended by some, including the two editors referred to above, to the whole work.  
The SpPr, probably the oldest source for this collection of texts, uses the title Saṃvitprakāśa only for verses belonging to the first Prakaraṇa,[^20]
and Ātmasaptati[^21] for closely related verses, quite similar both in content and style to the SP. All the latter verses come indeed from Prakaraṇa 2, entitled Ātmasaptati[^22] in mss. B and C, and Ātmasaṃstuti in ms. A.[^23] 

[^17]: A: Research Library, Srinagar, No. 1371 (Kashmiri devanāgarī); B: Benares Hindu University Library, Varanasi, No. C4003 (śāradā); C: Niedersächsische Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek, Göttingen, Cod. Ms. Sanscr. Vish 5 (śāradā).
[^18]: The two editions (both bearing the title of SP) are in fact only one as Tripathi’s is virtually identical (including the typographical setting) to Dyczkowski’s with the exception of a few corrections mainly of misprints. It would be possible to make some hypotheses about the reason why Dyczkowski decided to hand his edition over to Tripathi. About the “story” of Dyczkowski’s edition see TORELLA 1994, p. 482.
[^19]: In the three mss. the colophon reads: saṃvitprakāśo nāma prathamaṃ prakaraṇam.
[^20]: Once he calls it Saṃvitprakaraṇa (p. 38); see below. There is only one exception: the quotation p. 9 from Prakaraṇa 5.26 is introduced by uktaṃ saṃvitprakāśe (see below).
[^21]: On one occasion both editions of the SpPr (Kavirāja p. 112, Dyczkowski p.37) have uktaṃ hi svātmasaptatau, which must be a mere mistake (at least, all the Srinagar mss. mentioned above read uktaṃ hy ātmasaptatau).
[^22]: ātmasaptatir nāma dvitīyaṃ prakaraṇam.

[^23]: According to the number recorded by the Srinagar ms. A (see below), the second Prakaraṇa should have had nineteen verses more than the 60 that have come down to us. Thus, Ātmasaptati might be either a mistake for Ātmasaṃstuti or (much more probably) an approximate reference to the number of the

It is clear that Bhāgavatotpala considers the SP and Ātmasaptati as two distinct works.[^24] Instead, Maheśvarānanda ascribes to SP one verse belonging to Prakaraṇa 2 (MMP, p. 21) and two verses belonging to Prakaraṇa 3 (ibid., p. 25).[^25] Even admitting that it was Vāmanadatta himself that collected different treatises composed by him into a single work, he does not appear to have given this collection a particular title.  

Prakaraṇa 1 has the peculiar character of a philosophical stuti to Hari, also showing here and there subtle emotional nuances.  
The second mostly lacks these features, even though Vāmanadatta still calls it saṃstuti. [^26]  
These features are altogether absent in the other Prakaraṇas, which makes rather unlikely the hypothesis that the Prakaraṇas as a whole might have had the collective title of Viṣṇustuti. [^27] Of the 160 ślokas that Vāmanadatta himself mentions in one of the closing verses of Prakaraṇa 128 only 140 have survived. The title and the number of the extant verses of the other Prakaraṇas are as follows: ātmasaptati (vv. 60), vikalpaviplava (vv. 60), vidyāviveka (vv. 98), varṇavicāra (vv. 52), paramārthaprakāśa (vv. 27).29 The Srinagar ms. A has seven and half more verses, belonging to a seventh Prakaraṇa, after which the ms. ends abruptly. B and C end with the colophon of  verses (79) that composed it. The confusion might have been caused by the previous part of the colophon of Prakaraṇa 2: 

> imaṃ vāmanadattena  
> vihitām ātmasaṃstutim |  
> adhigamya vimucyate  
> jantavo bhavaviplavāt ||.  [^24] 

See SpPr pp. 37-38: 

> uktaṃ hi svātmasaptatau [read: hy ātmasaptatau] yadvad  
> vastu svabhāvena jñānena viṣayīkṛtam |  
> tadvat tādātmyam āyāti  
> jīvaḥ sarvamayo hy ataḥ || 
> 
> iti |  
> anyat saṃvitprakaraṇe – 
> 
> yathāgninā samāviṣṭaṃ  
> sarvaṃ tadrūpam īkṣyate |  
> tathā jñānasamāviṣṭaṃ  
> sarvaṃ tadrūpam īkṣyatām || 
> 
> iti. [^25] 

The fact that Maheśvarānanda uses a single title, i.e. the title of Prakaraṇa 1, also for verses coming from other Prakaraṇas,  
has only one precedent, but an important one,  
that of the SpPr referred to above, n. 20.  
One may surmise that, even though Saṃvitprakāśa is definitely the specific title only of Prakaraṇa 1,  
the intrinsic importance and renown of the latter and its occuring first in the collection of Prakaraṇas (and also being by far the longest) may have sporadically given the occasion of an extended appellation.

[^26]: See n. 23 above.
[^27]: Cf. SANDERSON 2009a, p. 108. On the only occasion Bhāgavatotpala identifies three verses quoted by him as stutau (p. 19) they all belong to Prakaraṇa 1. Once Vāmanadatta himself refers to one Haristuti, but this is a hymn composed by his daughter Vāmadevī (4.78cd).+++(5)+++ 

[^28]: SP 139:  ṣaṣṭyuttaraṃ ślokaśatam idaṃ bodhaṃ vināpi yaḥ | paṭhen madhuripor agre bhaktyā mokṣaṃ sa gacchati ||.
[^29]: After the colophon of each Prakaraṇa (except 1 and 4), the Srinagar ms. A records what was the original (?) number of verses: 79 (Prakaraṇa 2), 61 (Prakaraṇa 3), 52 (Prakaraṇa 5), 27 (Prakaraṇa 6).


[[433]]

Prakaraṇa 6, both having a lacuna between 4.90 and 6.22. The devanāgarī MS in the BORI Library bearing the title of SP has nothing to do with Vāmanadatta’s work.

We are left with a preliminary question:  
what happened in the Vaiṣṇava circles immediately before the time of Abhinavagupta  
to make at least three significant Pāñcarātra authors – Vāmanadatta, Bhaṭṭa Divākaravatsa and Bhāgavatotpala –  
enter into the philosophical and spiritual orbit of their śaiva adversaries?  
It has also been suggested the possibility of the inverted path (SANDERSON 2009a, p. 108),  
that is, the birth of the non-dual śaiva philosophy from the influence of these eccentric Vaiṣṇava developments (in primis, Vāmanadatta’s Prakaraṇas), a possibility that seems to me rather unlikely.  
It is not single points, but a whole constellation of typically śaiva themes that can be found there,  
particularly linked to the complex philosophical world of Utpaladeva.  

If, in this presentation of some aspects of Vāmanadatta’s work,  
I mainly focus on Prakaraṇas 1 and 2 it is because,  
apart from their probably being in themselves his most significant texts,  
they are by far the most quoted by the śaiva authors.  

First of all, in the complex mosaic of a philosophical stuti,  
written in a refined kāvya style, the SP proper, we find,  
within an undoubtedly Pāñcaratra doctrinal framework,  
a fascinating blend of rigourous speculation and devotional poetry,  
which at first sight reminds us of the then rising star of Utpaladeva,  
the actual founder of Pratyabhijñā, more or less contemporary to Vāmanadatta (and also often referrred to by Bhāgavatotpala),  
with his collection of śaiva stotras.  
The other Prakaraṇas share the same philosophical and spiritual attitude as the SP without, however, the bhakti nuances of the latter  
and the sense of intimate dialogue with Hari, emphasized by the frequent vocatives (nātha, prabhu, bhagavan, etc.) and above all by the constant addressing him as tvam. [^30]  

Some of the fundamental themes of Utpaladeva – unobjectifibility of consciousness, subject/object relationship and problematicity of the very notion of viṣaya – recur in several stanzas of the SP and Ātmasaptati: [^31] 

[^30]: Most of the tvaṃ of the SP turn to ahaṃ in the verses incorporated into the LT, where the Goddess herself is speaking.
[^31]: The text and numeration of the stanzas is according to my forthcoming edition (see Appendix).


> 2.5. The self cannot be object of cognition for anybody,  
> what is other than it is not logically admissible.  
> From the differentiation of the knowable derives the differentiation of the means of knowledge.  
> If there is no such differentiation, then what might produce the differentiation [of knowledge]?
> 
> 2.6. If the self were knowable, its knower would be “other”; but then the self would be[come] “other.” “Other,” in fact, is what is the object of knowledge.  
2.56. Consciousness alone shines; that which is other from it is illuminated. What is illuminated is the object, and how can the object subsist without a subject?  
1.10. Just as whatever is penetrated by fire is seen as being of the same essence as fire, in the same manner whatever is penetrated by consciousness is to be seen as being of the same essence as consciousness.  
1.11. An intrinsic and definite status is inconceivable for things,  
> dependent as they are on a subject that knows them, and consequently they can only manifest themselves, by their very nature, as having the knower as their essence.  
1.12. The fact that things have You as their essence, no one disputes.  
Their capacity of being known demonstrates this: indeed, only that which in itself is light may be made to shine.[^32]  
1.24. If knowledge (vedanam) knows something after bringing the knowable object to having knowledge as its own form, then how to speak of knowable object and knowing subject (vedakatā) as two distinct realities?[^33]
> 
> 2.8. “Making [something] an object of knowledge” – the wise ones say in this connection – is the same as “making [it] one’s own.” What is universally accepted for any other reality, why should it not be so for consciousness?  
2.9. What has not been made its own by consciousness (saṃvidāsvīkṛtaṃ) cannot be termed “object of knowledge” (viṣaya).[^34]  


[^32]: Cf. ĪPK 1.5.2 (cf. TORELLA 2002, pp. 111-112).
[^33]: The text remains doubtful owing to the oscillation in the mss. and old quotations between vedanatā and vedakatā; also the emendation of vedanam to vedakaḥ might be considered.

[^34]: Also the reading saṃvidā svīkṛtaṃ “what has been made its own by consciousness” could be considered (this would anticipate the conclusion made in the following ardhaśloka).



[[435]]

> [But] what has been made its own by a certain entity becomes identical with such entity.
[Then,] how can the very designation of “object of knowledge” stand?[^35]-

> 2.35. While knowledge can shine autonomously being separated from the senses and without being muddied by the objects of knowledge, the
same cannot be said of the object of knowledge.  
2.36. It is said in this connection that in order to make known the objects
of knowledge the three means of knowledge work separately being concerned with distinct classes of objects of knowledge. [But] the same does
not hold for knowledge.

Another favourite topic of Utpaladeva’s discourse is the alleged externality of the object of knowledge (ĪPK 1.8.5, 1.8.7; cf. TORELLA 2002, pp. 148-150). In the same vein, Vāmanadatta says:

> 2.32. Even establishing the other as other is not possible until the other is
assimilated by the self, since only when it is known does the other become the other.
2.44. If it were possible to define an object as being external even when
it has entered one’s consciousness, then it would be external to consciousness itself, so how could it be said to be “its” [of consciousness]?
2.45. If, on the other hand, it has not entered one’s consciousness, how
can its existence be known, since only consciousness has the task of
hunting down being and non-being?

The examination of the nature of relation is closely connected with
Utpaladeva’s treatment of the same topic in ĪPK 1.2.10-11 (TORELLA 2002, pp. 95-98), 2.4.14 (TORELLA 2002, p. 183) and the Sambandhasiddhi.

> 2.17. There can be no relationship between two things complete and realised in themselves (siddha), because all expectation is lacking between
them; and not even between two that are not realised and established, because as such they would not exist. So any relationship in reality does
not exist.
2.54. What is real/existing (satāṃ) is without any such “requiring” because it is already complete and realised in itself, nor conversely is
“non-requiring” possible in what is non-existent owing to its non-realisation. Things lacking “dependency” have neither the nature of the knower
nor of the knowable.

[^35]: Cf. e.g. Utpaladeva’s Īśvarapratyabhijñāvivṛti ad 1.4.1 (TORELLA 2007b, p. 544).



The status of cause presupposes sentiency. Only the conscious agent subject can be a causal agent (ĪPK 2.4.1-21; cf. TORELLA 2002, pp. 175-188).

> 1.63. It is well known that everything has You as cause, since Your presence is apparent in everything. Given that everything shows the presence of consciousness, the cause [of everything] cannot be something
without consciousness.
2.22. Whatever is denied the quality of active subject cannot assume the
role of instrument, etc. [...]
Vāmanadatta appears also reminiscent of how Utpaladeva deals
with the theme of memory in ĪPK 1.2.3, 1.3.1ff. (cf. TORELLA
2007b).
1.20. You, always omniscient, are present in the heart of everyone: if
this were not so, how otherwise could one account for memory, whose
object is something that no longer exists?

The presence of Bhartr̥hari’s teaching is evident at several places of Vāmanadatta’s works,  
and, as is well known, it was through Utpaladeva that Bhartr̥hari became one of the main pillars of nondual śaiva philosophy (TORELLA 2009).+++(5)+++

> 1.7. It is merely a question of the power of the word: that is, the fact that
it brings about a fragmentation of the real, which itself would be unitary,
by virtue of a multiplicity of functions.
5.26. The word is the cause of all human activities: this is what reason
shows, it is not only scripture that says so. In fact, there is no operation
whatsoever without the work of discursive thought, nor is there discursive thought without the word.

The concept of pratibhā as the ultimate ground for the means of knowledge  
appears to be nourished with Utpaladeva’s ideas as expressed particularly in the Īśvarapratyabhijñāvivṛti (in turn, being a development of Bhartr̥hari’s doctrine):[^36]

[^36]: Cf. TORELLA 2013.

2.37. Sensorial knowledge derives directly from the object, inferential
knowledge comes from the relation [between objects]; it has been said



[[437]]

that they [sensorial knowledge and inferential knowledge] are the root of
āgama. No other means of knowledge exists.
2.38. It is required that, in turn, these three means of knowledge have intuition as their own soul, otherwise it would impossible to account for
ascertainment of truth and error.
2.39ab. Intuition is only known by introspective self-awareness; it is present in a form exempt from succession (akramātmikā) within the various
activities.37
Just like Utpaladeva, Vāmanadatta makes frequent use of the simile of the mirror or crystal and the reflection on them to account
for the relationship between consciousness and the images of the
allegedly external objects.
1.51. Just as the child has no separate cognition of the mirror without his
face [reflected in it], just so he who is not wise does not grasp the consciousness from which the knowable has been extracted.
1.54-56. Just as the true nature of a crystal continuously coloured by
other things is not perceived owing to its excessive transparency, in the
same way, O Blessed One, Your own body, which is united with the various beings, owing to its absolute limpidity is not perceived without
them. Neither for this [reason] can we affirm that such a crystal does not
exist separately from whatever colours it, or that the pure body of consciousness does not exist once liberated from the form of things.
1.57-59. Just as it is impossible to indicate separately the intrinsic existence of a universal from which all particulars have been removed – but
this does not imply that it does not exist –, and just as it is impossible to
indicate the intrinsic existence of gold once it has been freed from its various forms, such as earring, etc. – but this does not imply that it does
not exist –, so be it said of Your permanent, intimate, pure nature, once
pleasure and pain have been eliminated. It consists of consciousness,
only knowable through introspective intimate awareness.
1.40. Pleasure and pain do not appear, discrimination has no firm
ground: everything appears the same once You, the sun of consciousness, rise.

[^37]: If we accept the reading kramātmikā, transmitted in all the extant mss., the meaning does not change significantly: “it [only] appears in a successive form within... ”


> 1.41. For the blind You are the one in whom there is no darkness, for the
deaf You are the one in whom the Voice never disappears. Starting from
Brahmā to the animals, You are the same in the knowledge of everybody.
Hari is present at all levels of ordinary reality. In fact, since everything is equally penetrated by Him, there is no real difference between mokṣa and saṃsāra. If the various ordinary reality can occur
in its multifariousness it is precisely because of His constituting its
permanent and undifferentiated basis (cf. ĪPK 2.3.15b samabhittitalopame; ĪPK 1.3.6-7, 2.4.19; cf. TORELLA 2002, pp.103-104,
186).

> 1.95. No ordinary activity – whether corporeal or verbal or mental – can
take place if Thou, O Lord, art not already present in it and established
beforehand.[^38]

> 1.89. Two persons who meet and speak of ordinary things thereby express something that however has You as its final subject, [even] without speaking of You [directly]. [...]
1.36. Albeit directly perceptible, in that You transcend all conceptual
processes, You are “forgotten” – like something in front of someone
whose mind is elsewhere.
1.39. Lights do not shine if Your light does not rise. You are the only
one that can truly be called light; all the others are like the darkness.
2.58. In actual fact, there is no bondage, and there being no bondage,
there is no liberation either. These two entities are both fabricated by
discursive thought and in themselves are nothing.
1.60. I bow to Brahman which is without specification, partless, outside
space and time, light to itself, exclusively consisting of consciousness,
perennially risen.
1.61. Were You not exempt from particularization among particulars,
the comprehension of the particular would be impossible as everything
resides in itself.
1.62. In You, Lord, who are the cause, there is no differentiation, then
how could differentiation be in the effects forming this world? Therefore, o Padmanābha, the world is without differentiation.

[^38]: Cf. the so-called ādisiddhasūtra (1.1.2) of ĪPK.


[[439]]

1.64. You are the substratum of everything, made of everything and
transcending everything. How is it possible that there be space and time
in You, who are infinite and without action (niṣkriyātmani)?39
1.66. The wise ones know you to be what never declines from its own
nature, what is not modified by other realities, what is not delimited by
other realities, this permanent being You are.
1.67. Time, etc. arise from You with the aim of delimiting what can be
delimited. But what can time etc. do to You, whose own form is immeasurable?
In the motif of the presence of Hari, or consciousness, in the empty
space that separates two physical realities, or two thoughts or sensorial experiences, or two phonemes in a word, we can detect Vāmanadatta’s acquaintance with the texts of the Spanda school and
with śaiva scriptures such as the Vijñānabhairava.
40
1.4. The mind that, having expelled conceptual constructs, remains in
the middle state, experiences there the immaculate flow of consciousness.
1.42. Always pure does this perception remain, albeit variegated according to the various forms. At the moment in which the passing from one
form to another occurs, at that moment too perception is [fully] immaculate.
1.43. Just as a garment originally white and then dyed cannot take any
other colour unless it first returns to its original white [...]
1.44. [Just as] he who pronounces a phrase, how could he pass from one
phoneme to another, if in the interval, he did not repose in You, who are
pure consciousness?
1.45. In the same way, consciousness, which is pure by nature and assumes one form or another, stays pure in the interval between abandoning one form and passing on to another.
* * *

[^39]: The absence of kriyā in Hari, stated also in SP 73b, as a point of apparent disagreement with the śaiva paramādvaita, will be treated in my forthcoming edition and translation.
[^40]: Very intriguing is the mention of the Krama goddess Kālakarṣaṇī in 4.13d.


The season in which a few brilliant personalities of Pāñcarātra surrendered to the fascination by the philosophers and spiritual masters of the śaiva paramādvaita was short,  
in any case lasting no more than three to four decades.  
All the same, the mainstream of Pāñcarātra never forgave them, and committed them to disdainful oblivion.  
Their memory however has survived for centuries in the śaiva circles,  
proud perhaps of having attracted such brilliant outsiders.+++(5)+++
