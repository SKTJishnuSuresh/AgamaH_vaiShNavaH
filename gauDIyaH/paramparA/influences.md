## pAncharAtra 
kAshmIri (eg. keshava of kramadIpa) is prominent. 

## mAdhva connection
> The idea of Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavam even having a mantra-sambandha with the Madhva Sampradāya is controversial, let alone any sort of doctrinal linkage... The earliest source mentioning such a connection is Gaura Gaṇoddeśa Dīpikā, and even there is it nothing more than a mantra paramparā.

> Madhavendra Purī, Īśvara Purī, and Mahāprabhu himself all took ekadaṇḍa sannyāsa.

## Folk influence
The "eastern" bit might be "sarasvatI as spouse of viShNu" type (presumably originally folk) stuff. 

> A +++(presumably eastern)+++ commentator to Keshava Kashmiri, identifies the two devis accompanying Vishnu/Krishna in a particular dhyana as lakShmI and sarasvatI. 

## advaitin influence
gauDIya view is heavily centered on bhAgavata - especially as interpreted by the early advaitin commentator.
