The numbering has been revised in the 2.0 version, after I worked on editing Ananta Das Panditji’s translation and commentary. A numbering system must serve some purpose, and the most logical system is to group paragraphs, or at least coherent segments, into single numbered sections. Since Ananta Dasji chose to break the sections up in the way given here in order to comment on them, I have decided to follow his divisions and number accordingly. The old numbers are placed in brackets, in plum, in their appropriate place.
