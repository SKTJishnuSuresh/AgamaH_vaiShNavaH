The original GGM edition was based on the Yadavpur edition. This second edition, which has thousands of corrections, emendations and improvements, is based on the Puridas edition (P) of 1951. 

It should be further noted here that we were fortunate enough to get hold of Pandit Kanai Lal Adhikari Panchatirtha's copy of the above P edition, which he had annotated and corrected. So some of his later emendations have been incorporated here. 

Manuscripts used by Puridas (P):
