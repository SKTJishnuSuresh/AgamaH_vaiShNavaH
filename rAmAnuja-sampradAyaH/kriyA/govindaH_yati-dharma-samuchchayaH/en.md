CHAPTER ONE The Rule Sanctioning Itinerant Asceticism 1. OM-at the time of meditation we hear it proclaim Him! Vedas, that string of texts, are a ladder to reach Him! He is Hari! In Him we take refuge! 2. Śrī is His wife, the eagle is His banner.

Lord of the Universe, victory is yours! Once He took up the ascetic emblem, and from heretic assaults He protected the Threefold Veda.1 3.I, Yadava, have collected all the vedic and scriptural2 passages pertaining to renunciation, and I am now setting out to compose this "Collection of Ascetic Laws." 4-5. It consists of eleven chapters: Rule, Age of Candidate, Insignia, Procedure, Principal Activity, Daily 1. There appears to have been a myth according to which Visnu, incarnate as a triple-staffed Brahmin renouncer, once protected the vedic tradition from heretical attacks; cf. Ch. 6.303. The historical reference, if any, of this statement, however, is unclear.

2. Throughout this book, I have translated the term "smrti" as "scripture" or "scriptural" and the terms "veda" and "śruti" as "Veda(s)" or "vedic." The first refers to a variety of traditionally authoritative texts, including the technical literature on ritual and law, the Puranas, and the Epics. Yadava, by and large, reserves this term for the Dharmasastric texts.

29 30 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism Practices, Proper Conduct, Rules on Insignia, Wandering and Residence, Penances, and Funeral. In it I present systematically the Law of ascetics culled from the Law Books. 6-9. The authors of these Law Books are Manu, Visnu, Yama, Angiras, Vasistha, Dakṣa, Samvarta, Śātātapa, Parāśara, Katyāyana, Uśanas, Vyasa, Apastamba, Brhaspati, Hārīta, Sankha, Likhita, Yajnavalkya, Atri, Gautama, Bodhayana, Dakṣa the Elder, Kasyapa, Kapila, Kratu, Sandilya, Jābāla the Elder, Dattatreya, Devala, Gargya, Vasistha the Elder, Viśvāmitra, Galava, Medhātithi, Bharadvaja, Jamadagni, Saunaka, Paithīnasi, Satyakāma, Vayu, and so forth. 10. The Law that I present here has been gathered solely from those sections of their books devoted to the topic of renunciation and not from other sections of those books or from the Epics and Puraṇas.

11. To begin with, I will examine whether in fact there exists a rule authorizing renunciation.3 Opponent's Position 12. Some claim that there indeed is no such rule, because one is not found in the Veda, and because scriptures that contradict the Veda are without authority. 13. That is the view of Gautama:4 There is, however, only one order of life according to the Venerable Teacher, because the householder's life is expressly prescribed. [GDh 3. 36) 3. It is a basic assumption in Brahmanical theology and exegesis that there has to be a specific and identifiable vedic rule authorizing a given practice or rite for it to be considered part of dharma. Regarding the long-standing controversy on the legitimacy of ascetic and celibate modes of life, see Olivelle 1993.

4. For a detailed discussion of Gautama's and Bodhayana's views on the orders of life, see Olivelle 1993, 83-91. The basic argument of both is that only the householder's life is explicitly prescribed in currently available vedic texts ("express vedic texts": see Ch. 1.16). It is a well-known principle of Brahmanical hermeneutics that the Veda is the supreme authority in matters of dharma. Other scriptures (smrti) are considered authoritative because they are, at least in principle, based on the Veda. An express vedic text (pratyakṣaśruti) is a vedic passage that is preserved within a vedic school (sakha) and available for examination. A purported scriptural (smrti) passage that contradicts such a text is judged null and void. If no express vedic text exists to support a scriptural statement, then the latter retains its authority and is supposed to be based on a lost or unavailable vedic text. In such cases a vedic text is presumed-or more technically, inferred-to exist, although it is currently unavailable. Such a presumed vedic text-technically called anumitaśruti or "inferred vedic text" is never allowed to contradict an express vedic text. Since the acceptance of celibate orders of life contradicts the vedic injunction to marry and to procreate, Gautama and Bodhayana argue, scriptural passages authorizing such states are without authority.

1. The Rule Sanctioning Itinerant Asceticism 14. Bodhāyana states: Some maintain that there is a fourfold division of this very Law.

Four [paths leading to the gods traverse between heaven and earth. Place us on that among them, all you gods, which will bring us unfailing prosperity]. [TS 5.7.2.3] This text has only an invisible purposes and, therefore, refers to categories of rites, namely, vegetable offering, soma offering, animal offering, and offering with a ladle.

Now, these orders are student, householder, forest hermit, and wandering ascetic. A student serves his teacher until death. A forest hermit kindles his fire according to the procedure for ascetics and lives in the forest, conducting himself in accordance with the Book on Hermits, eating roots and fruits, and practicing austerities. He should bathe at dawn, noon, and dusk, and subsist on wild produce. He may also subsist on almsfood, but he should never enter a village. Wearing matted hair and clothed in bark or deer skin, he shall not eat what has been stored for over a year.

31 5. This passage from the BDh differs considerably from the critical edition. That edition here reads adṛṣṭatvāt, which according to Būhler and the commentator, Govinda, means "Because no other meaning is to be found." This, according to Bodhayana, is the reason for interpreting the vedic text "Four paths leading to the gods..." (TS 5.7.2.3) as referring to the four types of sacrifices and for rejecting the interpretation made by the proponents of the system of four orders, according to whom the "four paths" refer to the four orders of life. The variant reading recorded by Yadava appears, on the contrary, to be a reference to the well-known principle of Brahmanical hermeneutics that the Vedas, and therefore dharma, must always have an invisible purpose or aim; their results are manifested after death. According to this interpretation, Bodhayana argues against the opponent's interpretation because the vedic text, having by definition an invisible purpose, can refer only to sacrifices. The implication appears to be that the various modes of life subsumed under the four orders serve only worldly purposes. This appears also to be the point made a little later on with the expression "drstarthatvāt", "For they have a visible purpose." 6. Technically called śramanaka, this is a special ritual procedure for establishing a sacred fire before a forest hermit leaves for the forest. A version of this procedure is given in the VaiDh 2.1. The fire of a hermit itself is often referred to as "Śramanaka fire", see VaiDh 2.1-5.

7. Būhler, following Govinda, takes "vaikhanasaśastra" to be a treatise composed by the sage Vikhanas, regarded as the founder of the institution of forest hermits. I prefer to translate this expression as referring merely to a treatise on hermits. It is also possible that it refers to such treatises in general rather than to a specific one.

8. Literally, "what is not grown in a village." The total physical separation of forest hermits from society is highlighted by their abstention from using anything mediated by civilization, whether it be cultivated food or manufactured clothing. One law book prohibits them from "stepping on plowed land" (GDh 3.32), the prime symbol of civilized geography.

32 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism A wandering ascetic should forsake his kin and wander about without possessions. After going to the wilderness, he should shave his head completely or keep only his topknot, wear just a loincloth, and reside in one place during the rains. Clothed in an ocher garment, he should beg for food when pestles have been set aside and embers extinguished, when the people have finished their meals and removed the dishes. He shall not hurt any creature by verbal, mental, or physical acts of hostility. He should carry a water strainer for use in purifications and use for ritual purposes only water that has been drawn out.9 They proclaim: "We stick to the middle, rejecting the fire sacrifices to the gods and separating ourselves. from both sides."10 There is, however, only one order of life according to the Venerable Teacher, because a person does not bear children in the others. In this connection, they quote: There was once a demon named Kapila, the son of Prahlada. It was he who made these divisions in his effort to compete with the gods. A wise man, therefore, should pay no heed to them.

For they have a visible purpose. On this point, when they quote!! 9. Flowing water, such as that of a river, is always pure and can be used without straining. Stagnant water (for example, in wells and ponds) must be drawn out in a vessel, strained with a cloth, and poured from the vessel to make it run before it can be used for ritual purposes. See Ch. 6.41-44.

10. "We" probably refers to wandering ascetics. The meaning appears to be that ascetics take to their path with this type of belief or proclamation. The meaning of "both" (sides, ends, or extremes?) and "the middle" is unclear, however. Govinda, followed by Būhler, takes "both" to mean this world and the next and "middle" to mean Brahman. In a forthcoming article entitled "The Earliest Brahminical Reference to Buddhism?" Richard Gombrich has suggested that the middle may be a reference to the Buddhist "middle way" (the critical edition of BDh reads, in fact, madhyamam padam, middle state or path). It may, however, be possible to interpret this difficult phrase within the context of the RV (10.71.9) passage cited later. There, people who do not participate in ritual are said to "proceed neither to this side nor to the other side." The meaning, at least within Bodhayana's understanding of this text, appears to be that such people do not gain prosperity in this world or in heaven after death, two major goals of the vedic ritual. In this light, one may see the ascetics as rejecting both those goals in favor of the "middle," which may refer to the goal of final liberation.

11. See n. 5. The line of Bodhayana's argument is that when supporters of celibate asceticism cite vedic proof-texts such as this from the TB, a passage that is also cited in the BaU 4.4.23 in support of Upanisadic doctrines, the upholders of marriage and ritual religion can quote many other texts that argue against celibacy. This is an excellent example of the internal controversies regarding proper belief and proper action that went on within the Brahmanical tradition itself. The targets of the legal authors' critique were mainly their colleagues who espoused different and often ascetic ideas, rather than Buddhists and other heretics, as it is often supposed.

1. The Rule Sanctioning Itinerant Asceticism This eternal greatness [of a Brahmin is neither increased nor reduced by rites. The self knows that greatness of his. When someone knows it, he is not stained by evil deeds]. [TB 3.12.9.7-8] one should reply by quoting At the time of death [a man without the knowledge of the Veda does not turn his mind to that great all-perceiving self], set ablaze by whose power the sun gives warmth [and a father in his son is provided with a father from generation to generation].12 [TB 3.12.9.7] These people who proceed neither to this side nor to the other side, who are neither Brahmins nor participants at Soma sacrifices-they make use of speech in evil ways and weave their web in ignorance. [RV 10.71.9] 13 Through offspring, O Fire, may we obtain immortality. [RV 5.4.10] At his very birth a Brahmin is born with three debts: a debt of vedic studentship to the seers, a debt of sacrifice to the gods, and a debt of offspring to the forefathers. [TS 6.3.10.5] There are innumerable such statements on people's association with debts, as well as direct prohibitions.14 [BDh 2.11.9-33] 15. Āpastamba says: Study of the triple Veda, studentship, procreation, faith, austerity, sacrifice, gift giving-we are with those who perform these. Those who commend other things will become dust and perish. [ApDh 2.24.8] 33 16. Therefore, no celibate orders of life exist, because they are not sanctioned in the Veda and because scriptural texts lose all authority when they contradict an express vedic text [see Ch. 1.13 n. 4].

12. The statement about the father becoming a father (pitṛman) through his son is not altogether clear. It is clear, however, that it resonates with other vedic statements regarding the importance of procreation. In another place the TB (1.5.5.6) affirms that "in your offspring you are born again; that, O mortal, is your immortality." The Aitareya Aranyaka (2.5) claims that a father is born a second time in his son, and the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (7.13.1) asserts that a father attains immortality when he sees the face of his living son. The point of all this for Bodhāyana's argument is that the celibate state authorized by the system of the orders of life (aśrama) goes against explicit vedic statements on the necessity of begetting children, especially sons.

13. The meaning of this very difficult verse is unclear, especially the last phrase containing the hapax legoumenon siri. The reason for its citation here, however, is clear. The verse, as Bodhayana understands it, condemns those who reject ritual practices and use speech (vac), probably meaning the vedic texts, in evil ways. This, according to Bodhayana, is precisely what the creators of the asrama system did by using vedic proof-texts in support of their theory.

14. The vedic passages dealing with debts implicitly prohibit celibate states of life. Bodhayana, further, affirms that the Vedas contain injunctions that directly and explicitly prohibit such modes of life. This last statement does not appear in the critical edition of the BDh.

34 Objection Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 17. Now someone may object that there indeed exists an express vedic text among the followers of the White Yajurveda: Desiring this very world, wandering ascetics depart for the ascetic life. [BaU 4.4.22] And also: Eschewing erudition, therefore, let a Brahmin live like a simpleton. Eschewing both erudition and simplicity, then, he becomes a sage. [BaU 3.5.1] 18. That text points out also the conduct: On knowing this, indeed, the people of old did not wish for offspring, for they thought: "Our self is our world; so why should we need offspring?" [BaU 4.4.22] And also: They did not offer the daily fire sacrifice. [?] Reply 19. We answer this objection with a question: is itinerant asceticism enjoined for the benefit of the agent or, like rites such as holding the hand, for the benefit of some other ritual act?15 If, on the one hand, it is for the agent's benefit, then, according to the maxim "It should be heaven," its purpose has to be either heaven or something else. 16 Now, its purpose cannot be heaven, because that would negate its inclusion within the subject of liberation, for obviously every treatise that enjoins itinerant asceticism does so exclusively within the section. devoted to the subject of liberation. Consequently, we are compelled to affirm some degree of correlation between it and the subject of lib- 15. Brahmanical hermeneutics divides all ritual acts into those that directly benefit the ritual actor (puruṣartha) and those that are required only by the rite itself and therefore perform a merely ritual purpose (kratvartha). In the example alluded to, the marriage ceremony as a whole serves the purpose of the ritual actors-the bride and groom-but the groom's particular act of taking the bride's hand serves a merely ritual purpose. For this hermeneutical principle, see PMS 4.1.2. In this entire discussion by Yadava, the terms for asceticism and renunciation (pārivrajya, samnyasa,) are taken to refer directly to the rite for becoming an ascetic rather than to the ascetic life in general. It is only within this context that the analogy to other vedic rites makes sense.

16. This maxim deals with an abstruse exegetical principle spelled out in PMS 4.3.7.13-16. Simply stated, the maxim asserts that the single goal of the various rites prescribed in the Veda is heaven. If we follow this maxim, then the rite of renunciation-if it qualifies as a vedic rite-should have heaven as its goal. If not, then the opponent has the burden of presenting something else as its specific goal.

1. The Rule Sanctioning Itinerant Asceticism 35 eration. It is impossible, however, to make such an assertion, because the Vedas clearly teach that liberation is achieved only through knowledge: Upon knowing him in this manner, one transcends death. There is no other path along which to travel. [VS 31.18] Sacrificial presents do not reach there, nor do those who practice austerities but lack knowledge. Only through knowledge does a man reach that place where desires are vanquished. [SB 10.5.4.16] 20. Now, some claim that itinerant asceticism is enjoined as a necessary adjunct to the acquisition of knowledge. That is not true. Since the acquisition of knowledge is open to householders as well, it is improper to assume that there is an injunction establishing a separate order of life for that purpose. Even if we were to so assume, it would not establish a separate order of life. On the contrary, it would only institute a particular vow called "itinerant asceticism" intended exclusively for householders, in a manner similar to the vow of maintaining three sacred fires.17 And we understand it to be a particular observance entailing the abandonment of attachments, an observance that is not incompatible with the household life one has already undertaken. Practices found in the scriptural texts are not to be accepted when they contradict the Veda. The very term "itinerant asceticism," moreover, is not noted elsewhere as referring to a separate order of life, for if it were, that order would be rendered nonvedic. So we must conclude that this vedic text contains only an illustrative referencel to itinerant asceticism, an institution well known in the scriptures, and that the intention of that text here is only to praise knowledge-saying, in effect, that knowledge is so great that by its power people do not fall into sin even when they relinquish rites that have been enjoined on them.

17. Three sacred fires are required for the performance of several vedic sacrifices. Although all Brahmins were expected ideally to maintain all three fires continuously in their homes, from early times on only exceptional people who were professional priests did so. Such persons were referred to by the technical term "āhitagni." By the middle ages this practice appears to have become so rare as to be considered a special and extraordinary vow. According to the argument of Yadava's hypothetical adversary, renunciation should be considered a similar vow that exceptional householders may undertake voluntarily.

18. The reference is to the texts of the BaU that the opponent had cited in support of renunciation as constituting a separate order of life; see Ch. 1.17-18. "Illustrative reference" (anuvada) is a technical term in vedic exegesis and refers to statements that have no injunctive power of their own but merely repeats by way of illustration or commendation rules that have already been laid down. The opponent's intent is to deny any injunctive force to this vedic text with regard to renunciation.

36 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 21. Thus, some teachers hold that there is no order of life called itinerant asceticism, because [a] there is no exclusive vedic observance that is not open to householders and constitutes a special order of life, an observance that would parallel, for example, the daily fire sacrifice,19 and [b] customs such as begging for food are just elements of good conduct, in much the same way as twilight worship and the like, and as such they are intended to promote observances that do constitute an order of life and are not observances that could on their own constitute an order of life.

Author's Position 22. To all this we reply. There is an exclusive observance known as the yoga of knowledge. The following vedic text, accordingly, notes at the outset the rites beginning with "truth" and ending with "mental,"20 goes on to prescribe renunciation: "They say that renunciation, therefore, surpasses these austerities" [MNU 538], and finally enjoins the yoga of knowledge as what is expressed by the term renunciation: "One should attach oneself to the self" [MNU 540]. Now, the yoga of knowledge consists in the sole pursuit of knowledge. Such a pursuit, evidently, is not possible for householders, because they are required to perform in addition rites such as the daily fire sacrifice. Only the yoga of rites, consequently, is applicable to them. Now, the yoga of rites consists in the simultaneous pursuit of both knowledge and rites, from which pursuit its practitioners obtain liberation. Wandering ascetics, on the other hand, attain liberation solely through the yoga of knowledge. Because they do not perform rites, therefore, the same text in a subsequent passage shows how they accomplish the ritual and prescribes that a wandering ascetic should carry it out every day without fail: "In the case of a man who knows the sacrifice in this manner, [his self is the sacrificer, faith is his wife, his body is the fire 19. The daily fire sacrifice (agnihotra) is both a vedic observance and a practice that is meant exclusively for householders. The argument here is that such an exclusive practice meant solely for renouncers is not found in the Veda.

20. The reference is to section 505-15 in the MNU. These eleven statements define the "ultimate" (param) progressively as truth, austerity, control, tranquility, generosity, virtue (dharma), procreation, fires, fire sacrifice, sacrifice, and mental (offering).

1. The Rule Sanctioning Itinerant Asceticism 37 wood...]."21 This is not merely a laudatory statement but a true injunction, because it has no precedent.22 23. Is it not true that even wandering ascetics perform rites such as the twilight worship? Certainly, but they are customary practices, and as such they are performed solely to promote the duties of one's order of life and not to obtain liberation. Only the yoga of knowledge aims at liberation. Practices such as twilight worship foster that yoga, because, as stated in the following scriptural passages, a person who does not perform the twilight worship is not qualified to perform such yoga: A man who does not perform the twilight worship is always impure and is unfit to perform any rite.

And: The Vedas do not cleanse a man who pays no heed to good conduct.

We will point out, moreover, that practices such as silent prayer, austerity, and begging are included within restraints and constraints.23 Now, all branches of learning recognize that restraints, constraints, and the like are elements of yoga. Those practices, therefore, must also be included within the yoga of knowledge.

24. It is thus established that the yoga of knowledge pertains to wandering ascetics, while the yoga of rites pertains to householders. The Veda accordingly declares that a person can attain immortality only by abandoning rites: 21. This long passage (MNU 543-50) is an extensive allegory of the sacrifice that a renouncer performs internally. At this sacrifice his own body, bodily functions, and the act of eating are homologized with the various elements of the sacrifice. Such a renouncer performs a continuous and daily sacrifice by his very existence and by the daily activities he performs.

22. Here we encounter a bit of abstruse hermeneutical ratiocination. The issue addressed is whether the MNU passage cited here regarding the internal sacrifice has true injunctive power or is merely a laudatory statement. The latter type of vedic statements falls under the category known as anuvada, or illustrative statements (see Ch. 1.20 n. 18). These are not injunctions in their own right but are authoritative only because they refer to already-established injunctions. The author denies that the passage in question can be such a noninjunctive statement by saying that it has no precedent, i.e., that there is no previously established injunction of which it can be an illustration or praise. Consequently, it must be what Brahmanical hermeneutics calls an "original injunction" (apurvavidhi), that is, an injunction that prescribes a practice for the first time.

23. Restraints (yama) and constraints (niyama) are the first two steps of the eightfold yogic path: see Ch. 5.47f. The author wants to point out that the common practices of renouncers, such as begging for food, are in fact part and parcel of their yogic endeavor and are therefore also a part of their yoga of knowledge.

38 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism Not by rites, not by offspring, and not by wealth--but by renunciation did some people attain immortality. [MNU 227] And also: Firmly grasping the import of Vedantic wisdom, their hearts purified by the practice of renunciation, all these ascetics attain at the end of time in the world of Brahma final liberation from the highest immortality.24 (MNU 229-30] The Blessed Vasudeva, likewise, declares: [I have formerly taught, my dear, a twofold method of perfection:] the yoga of knowledge for followers of Samkhya and the yoga of rites for yogins. (BhG 3.3] 25. Consequently, because an exclusive practice does exist [see Ch. 1.21 n. 19], we posit the existence of an order of life called "itinerant asceticism" that is sanctioned by the Veda. Because they are based on the vedic texts providing that sanction, moreover, the scriptural passages on this topic retain their authority. Now, practices connected with this order are not appropriate for householders, because, in the statement "They beg for their food" [BaU 4.4.22), the Veda enjoins on all ascetics the abandonment of property.25 It is established, therefore, that itinerant asceticism is a clearly distinct order of life.

26. That ends the first chapter, entitled "The Rule Sanctioning Itinerant Asceticism," of the Collection of Ascetic Laws composed by Yadava Prakāśa.

24. The meaning of this phrase is unclear. It may mean that these ascetics first attain the world of Brahma, defined here as "highest immortality," and from there are finally liberated (mokṣa) at the end of time. This verse occurs also in the Mundaka Upanisad (3.2.6) and in the Kaivalya Upanisad (1.4), where the reading is paramṛtāḥ (this reading is also found in some recensions of the MNU). The translation thus would be "... at the end of time, being supremely immortal, attain final liberation in the world of Brahma." 25. The argument is that begging is enjoined on all wandering ascetics. Begging implies abandoning all possessions. Such an abandonment is impossible for householders, both because of family responsibilities and, more importantly from a hermeneutical standpoint, because their obligation to perform rites requires that they possess the wealth needed to perform them. Consequently, the dharma of renouncers is exclusively theirs and cannot be practiced by householders. This supports the author's claim that renunciation constitutes an order of life distinct from that of the householder.CHAPTER TWO Age of Eligibility of a Candidate for Itinerant Asceticism 1. We will now consider the candidate's age of eligibility.

Renunciation after Marriage 2. According to one opinion, itinerant asceticism is permitted only after a person has lived as a forest hermit and not while a person is still a vedic student. 3. This view is supported by the following vedic texts: After giving to the teacher a gift that would please him, let him not cut off his line of offspring. [TU 1.11.1] 4. At his very birth a Brahmin [is born with three debts]. [TS 6.3.10.5: see Ch 1.14] Procreation is the very foundation. Spinning out well the thread of progeny, a man becomes free from his debt to the forefathers. [MNU 525] 5. Manu, likewise, states: Only after paying his three debts should a man set his mind on renunciation. Should he take to renunciation without paying them, he will fall.2 [MDH 6.35] 6. Yajnavalkya says: No one but a man who has studied the Veda, recited silent prayers, fathered sons, distributed food, established the sacred fire, and offered sacrifices according to his ability may set his mind on renunciation. [YDh 3.57] 1. The term "moksa" (lit., "liberation") in Manu and in Yajnavalkya (below, Ch. 2.6) refers specifically to the renunciatory mode that constitutes the fourth order of life devoted exclusively to the pursuit of personal liberation. For an extensive discussion of the meaning of this term in Manu, see Olivelle 1993, 137-42.

2. The meaning of "fall" here (and in similar contexts elsewhere) is not clear. It may refer to the falling into hell after death, to the fall from caste, or more generally to falling into a state of sin.

39 '40 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 7. Sankha and Likhita state: After he has lived as a forest hermit and has reached an advanced age, a man may freely take to itinerant asceticism.

8-10. Medhātithi says: Detached from ties to sons, wife, home, fields, cows, gold, and the like, as well as from human and divine pleasures revealed in the Vedas; freed from sin by reciting the Vedas and by performing sacrifices and austerities; with his heart made pure and his senses subdued through religious practices carried out over many lifetimes; and counseled by the Epics, Puranas, and the Veda-he strives after the highest state. Because he strives, he is called an ascetic.3 Only such an ascetic attains this highest bliss, and no one else.

Renunciation Permitted at Any Time 11. Some, on the other hand, are of the opinion that a person may take to itinerant asceticism freely either while he is a vedic student or from home or the forest. 12. This position is supported by a vedic passage from the Jābāli: After completing his vedic studies, he should become a householder. After he has been a householder, he should become a forest hermit. After he has been a forest hermit, he should depart for the ascetic life. Or rather, he may depart for the ascetic life while he is still a vedic student, or from home or the forest. [JU 64] 13. Yama says: After he has observed his vedic vow,4 a learned Brahmin who is impartial toward all creatures, both the mobile and the immobile, may devote himself to renunciation [see Ch. 2.5 n. 1).

14. Or else, a householder who has fathered sons and subdued himself and his senses, who yearns not for any pleasure, and who has done all he has to do may become a wandering ascetic.

15. We gather from this passage that, if someone is a vedic student, he should depart for the ascetic life only after he has completed his vow; if he is a householder, he should depart only after he has fathered a son-because it was already stated, "... one who has performed sac- 3. The author derives yati ("ascetic") from yatana ("striving"). The etymological connection between the two is uncertain, but it was a common practice in ancient India for an author to use such phonetic similarities to point out what he may have regarded as the essential nature of some institution or practice.

4. The vedic vow refers to the period of vedic studentship following a boy's vedic initiation.

2. Age of Eligibility 41 rifices, after drawing his sacred fires into his heart...";5 and if he is a forest hermit, he should depart only after he has performed austerities. This interpretation should be applied to what follows as well.6 This is also the object of Manu's statement: "Only after paying his three debts..." [see Ch. 2.5]. 16. Some declare: After he has truly come to know the highest Brahman, a vedic student, a widowed householder, or a forest hermit should give up attachments and become a wandering ascetic.

17. From this passage we gather that, if he is detached, itinerant asceticism is open to a widowed householder even before he has completed such duties as fathering a son. 18. Bṛhaspati says: Seeing that samsara is without any substance and longing to see the true substance, a man imbued with deep detachment should depart for the ascetic life even before he has married.

19. Or someone may do so after he has fathered children and offered a variety of sacrifices, while another may do so after his "half-body" has died, and yet another from the forest.

20. "Half-body" means wife, according to the statement: When a man's wife drinks liquor, half his body dies. [VaDh 21.15] and according to the vedic text: The wife is a full half of a man's body. [TS 6.1.8.5] 21-24. Śankha states: Having thus spent some time in the forest, a twice-born man should enter the celibate order of life. Even a vedic student may do so, however, if he has attained a high intensity of detachment by his knowledge of various Upanisads; if he has withdrawn all his senses and keeps them far from sensual objects; if he finds delight only in himself; if with his mind he 5. It is unclear where this statement was already made. No manuscript records it in any other section of the work. It may well refer to that part of Yama's text which Yadava does not include in the citation made here. Yadava may just be assuming that his readers are aware of this passage.

6. This means that when a text permits a student, householder, or forest hermit to renounce, we should assume that its author means that such people are eligible to renounce only when they have completed the duties of their respective states.

7. There is a play here on the Sanskrit word "sara" ("pith" or "substance"). Samsara, if one ignores the nasal, can mean "with substance." In reality, however, samsara is asara (or niḥsāra), that is, "without substance." The true substance that he seeks is Brahman; see also NPU 139. This is another example of the phonetic etymology 1 commented on in n. 3.

8. The expression "brahmasrama" may also mean the order devoted to (acquiring the knowledge of) Brahman. In either case, it clearly refers to the last order of life, i.e., renunciation.

42 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism has vanquished his adversaries; if he has got hold of his self and keeps it securely fastened by repeatedly engaging in yogic practices; if he has banished all attachments; and if he adheres strictly to his vow. Or even a twice-born householder, if he possesses the above qualities, may enter the celibate order of life after he has offered a sacrifice to Prajapati, given all his possessions as a sacrificial gift to the priests according to the prescribed rules, and deposited his sacred fires in himself.

Renunciation before Marriage Only for the Handicapped 25. In this manner, some vedic and scriptural texts advocate itinerant asceticism directly from vedic studentship, while others permit it only after a man has paid his debts and fulfilled other similar obligations. Given the resultant contradiction, some argue that the vedic and scriptural statements advocating renunciation directly from vedic studentship are made with reference to people such as the blind and the lame who are disqualified from performing rites. 26. This is supported by Likhita: As a result of merits he has accumulated over ten million lifetimes or by divine intervention, a man may become detached and display a strong yearning for Brahman.

27. After he has learned the true meaning of the Veda, it may become impossible for such a man to live at home. So he may depart for the ascetic life either while he is a student or, when he is old, from home or the forest.

9. The contradictions that result when vedic or scriptural texts prescribe mutually exclusive actions provided much of the grist for the hermeneutic mill of Brahmanical exegetes. Briefly, the hermeneutic rules provided three avenues to resolve contradictions: (a) A person could show that one of the statements in question is less authoritative than the other, either because one is vedic and the other is not (see Ch. 1.13 n. 4), or because there is some doubt regarding the injunctive power of one (see Ch. 1.20 n. 18). According to a well-known exegetical maxim, only statements of equal authority that contradict each other's provisions can give rise to an option (GDh 1.4). (b) One could show that the contradiction is only apparent by demonstrating that the provisions of the two have in view two different groups of individuals or two different periods of the same individual's life. This is called "restrictive option" (vyavasthitavikalpa), even though there is no true option here at all. This is by and large the preferred method of conflict resolution in Brahmanical hermeneutics (see Ch. 2.28 n. 10) and the one advocated by those who would restrict renunciation to ritually handicapped people. (c) When the first two avenues fail, the contradiction between equally authoritative texts creates an option. An individual may choose to follow either one. In the discussion below, and in general throughout the book, we will see these methods of conflict resolution used by various factions to buttress their own positions and to invalidate those of their opponents.

2. Age of Eligibility 28. A young and healthy man should live diligently as a householder, while the blind, the lame, the old, and lepers should resort to asceticism.10 Renunciation before Marriage for Detached People 43 29. Others, however, argue as follows: "Should we rather not assume that there is no real contradiction in either the vedic or the scriptural passages? Unable as he is to undertake itinerant asceticism, why should not a man who is not detached become a householder? For surely it is impossible for a man who is not detached to undertake itinerant asceticism." 30. Their position is supported by Dakṣa: Even those beings who are endowed with the highest virtuell fall under the control of sensual things. How much more, then, creatures with paltry virtue? And need we even talk about human beings? 31. Only a man whose passions have been extinguished, therefore, should take up the staff.12 Others do not have the capacity to do so, attracted as they are to sensual things.

32. There are a lot of twice-born men who make a living by using the emblem of the triple staff. According to scripture, however, a man who does not know Brahman is not worthy of the triple staff.

33. Likhita: After a twice-born man has performed the rite at which he renounces all things, if he returns to the world, the king should brand him with a dog's paw and make him a slave.

34. A man should renounce, therefore, only after he has first examined the purity of his heart for a long time and ascertained that his mind will not waver from the Law.

10. The first two verses of this quotation appear to contradict the view they are expected to support. If we were to argue in the manner of a Brahmanical exegete, however, we could take the last verse as qualifying the injunction that permits a detached person to renounce either before or after marriage. Thus, a detached man should get married if he is young and healthy, while he may renounce if he is old or handicapped. The option given in the injunction is thus not a true option, since the two alternatives refer not to the same but to different individuals. See the alternative (b) in the previous note.

11. The term "sattva" is used in Samkhya cosmology as the highest of the three strands (guna), which constitute material reality. The term here may have a cluster of meanings, including goodness, power, wisdom, and purity. It is unclear who these beings are, but their opposition to humans suggests that they are supernatural beings such as gods and seers.

12. This is a reference to the renunciatory rite at which the ascetic takes a bamboo staff as the emblem of his new state. See Chs. 3 and 4.

44 35. Yama: Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism Only when a man has quenched his passion and lust, attained perfect tranquillity, and become totally intent on Brahman does he become qualified to be a renouncer. Others do so just to gain a living.

36. There is no justification, moreover, for assuming that the vedic passage prescribing immediate renunciation13 is directed at those who are disqualified, because later on in the following passage the same text prescribes it separately for them:14 Further, regardless of whether he has taken the vow or not, whether he has graduated or not, and whether he has a sacred fire or not, [let him renounce on the very day that he becomes detached].15 [JU 64] 37. Jābāli the Elder states: Regardless of whether he has taken the vow or not, whether he has graduated or not, whether he has the domestic fire or not, whether he offers the daily fire sacrifice or not, let him fetch some fire from the village and....16 38. Now, the statement "the blind, the lame, the old, and lepers should resort to asceticism" [Ch. 2.28] does not contradict our position, because the terms "blind" and so forth have been explained in a different way. 39. Thus, for instance, Medhātithi says: When a man remains as unmoved when he sees a sixteen-year-old young lady as when he sees a newborn girl or a hundred-year-old woman, he is called a "eunuch." 13. I believe that the technical meaning of the term "utthanaśruti" (lit., "vedic text on rising up") is that the text prescribes immediate departure from society without regard to any other condition. See, for example, Ch. 2.25 above, where the same term is used with reference to texts that advocate renunciation directly from vedic studentship. The term vyuthana is used with this meaning by Samkara in his commentary on BaU 3.5.1: see Olivelle 1986, 79-91. The text to which Yadava refers here is the Jabali cited at Ch. 2.12.

14. The referent of "them" is unclear, but in all likelihood the author means that in the following passage the Jabali enjoins immediate renunciation specifically on those who are totally detached. "Separately" may signify the following: In the earlier passage (Ch. 2.12) immediate renunciation while a person was still a student was presented within the context of prescribing renunciation within the sequence of the orders of life for ordinary people. In that context there may be some justification in taking the rule of immediate renunciation as directed at those who are disqualified from marriage. In this text, on the other hand, no such doubt is possible, because the text speaks specifically and solely of those who are detached.

15. "Vow" refers to vedic initiation, and a snataka, here translated as one who has graduated from vedic school, is a young adult who has performed the ceremony that concludes the period of vedic studies. This ceremony concludes with a ritual bath, and hence the graduate is called snataka, "one who has taken the bath." 16. The author cites only the beginning of the passage, a common practice in this type of literature. He expects his reader to be familiar with these citations. I have been unable to trace the rest of this passage.

2. Age of Eligibility 40. When a man walks only to beg food and to answer nature's calls,,and even then does not travel beyond a league, he is called "lame." 41. When a wandering ascetic, as he stands or walks, does not look beyond six feet in front of him, unless there is some danger, he is said to be "blind." 42. As he hears words that are kind or unkind, soothing or scathing, when a man remains as if he had not heard them, he is said to be "deaf."17 45 43. The blind, moreover, are not qualified to become wandering ascetics because of the rule "He should place his foot on the ground after determining its purity by inspection."18 44. Neither are the lame or lepers, because of rules such as the following: Traveling to holy bathing places and temples, let him roam the earth like a worm along the path pointed out by the sun. 19 45. The rule of celibacy disqualifies eunuchs from itinerant asceticism, for celibacy is abstention from sex. Now abstention from sex does not arise at all in the case of a eunuch, because, remaining unmoved like a pillar, he does not have the capacity to engage in sex. Clearly abstention becomes a vow only for those who have the capacity.

46. Consequently, the vedic passage on debts is directed at those who are not detached. For those who are detached, on the other hand, only one path is open, and that is itinerant asceticism. 47. Accordingly, Bṛhaspati states: ... a man imbued with deep detachment should depart for the ascetic life even before he has married. [see Ch. 2.18] 48. Kratu: After he has truly come to know the highest Brahman, a vedic student, a widowed householder, or a forest hermit should give up attachments and become a wandering ascetic.

49. Śankha: Even a vedic student may do so, however, tachments; and if he adheres strictly to his vow.

if he has banished all at- 17. These verses and other similar ones are contained in the NPU 146-47; see also Ch. 7.130-36.

18. MDh 6.46. The verse literally means that he should place his foot purified by his gaze; that is, he should look carefully to see whether there are any insects or bugs before putting his foot down as he walks, lest he kill them. Jain mendicants use brooms to brush insects from their path. The point here is that this rule of Manu disqualifies the blind because they cannot visually inspect the ground.

19. The second half of the verse is found in the MBh 14.46.32. The point of the argument is that the lame would not be able to roam the earth or to visit holy places. How this text would disqualify lepers is less clear. Perhaps they would not be allowed to enter temples or sacred bathing places (tīrtha).

46 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 50. Or even a twice-born householder, if he possesses the above qualities, may enter the celibate order of life after he has offered a sacrifice to Prajapati, given all his possessions as a sacrificial gift to the priests according to the prescribed rules, and deposited his sacred fires in himself. [see Ch. 2.23-24] 51. Dattatreya: The triple staff is the emblem of Visnu. It is the means of liberation for twice-born people and signals the cessation of all rules. 20 That is the teaching of the Veda. It was prescribed of old by the Self-Existent One for those who had become disaffected with household life.21 52. The teachers 22 are of the opinion that a temporary vedic student23 is free to choose24 any of the four orders of life. 53. Vasistha accordingly states: There are four orders of life: vedic student, householder, forest hermit, and wandering ascetic. After studying one, two, or all the Vedas, a student who has not violated his vow of celibacy may enter whichever of these he prefers. [VaDh 7.1.3] 54. Apastamba also says: After learning the rites, he may undertake whichever he likes. [ApDh 2.21.5] 20. The term "dharma" in this context probably refers to the duties and laws of castes and orders of life. The renunciatory life is often depicted as transcending dharma.

21. The referent of "it" is unclear, but in this context it may refer to the triple staff. This half-verse is given within a different context in the Yls 2.32 (Olivelle 1987, 50,65).

22. This could, of course, be an honorific plural. In this type of literature such plurals invariably refer to authoritative figures of old whose views support those of the author. It also may be a literary device rather than an actual reference to a particular teacher.

23. Such a vedic student is distinguished from one who resolves to live as a student all his life. According to the original formulation of the aśrama system, which is presented here by Yadava, it was the temporary student who, at the completion of his period of study, chose an order in which he would spend his entire adult life. The first order in this scheme is permanent studentship, which, among others, the temporary student may choose. The choice of an asrama was limited to this crucial period of a man's life when he is about to assume adult responsibilities. On the original asrama system and for a discussion of the texts cited here, see Olivelle 1993, 73-101.

24. The term "icchāvikalpa," "free or unrestricted option," means that any student may freely choose an order of life he prefers. This type of option is different from the vyavasthitavikalpa, which restricts the choice to a particular group or class of people. See Cg. 2.25 n. 9.

2. Age of Eligibility 55. The Blessed Vyasa states: After duly acquiring vedic knowledge by serving his teacher, a twice-born man should give a gift of a cow to the teacher and, with his permission, take the ritual bath.

56. Then, that learned Brahmin may live in whichever order of life he prefers, either as a permanent student, or as a sage, or else as a wandering ascetic. 25 57. Gautama declares: For him, some assert, there is a choice of orders.26 [GDh 3.1] 47 58. Now with regard to the statement "Only after paying his three debts..." [see Ch. 2.5], that too-when we interpret it within the restrictions imposed on it by vedic and scriptural statements enjoining itinerant asceticism straight from vedic studentship for those who are detached-must refer exclusively to people with attachments. Alternatively, it may intend to point out that debts once assumed must be paid. 27 59. It is established, therefore, that a man who is detached may become a wandering ascetic while he is still a student, or from home or the forest. 60. Bṛhaspati accordingly states: When a man is attached to the Supreme Self and detached from all else, and when he is freed from all desires, he is fit to eat almsfood. [see NPU 139] 25. Only three of the four orders are listed here explicitly. However, the term "muni" ("sage") is ambiguous. It may refer to a householder or a hermit, and here it may perhaps include both.

26. "For him," that is, for a temporary student who has completed his vedic studies.

27. Yadava's intention is to show that Manu's passage must refer to people who are not detached, for otherwise it would be rendered null and void by contradicting vedic texts. Alternatively, Manu may intend to state only that those who have assumed debts must pay them before taking to renunciation. As Vijñānesvara, another great medieval theologian, points out (commenting on YDh 3.56-57), it is foolish to think that a person is literally born with these debts. One assumes them when one becomes qualified to pay them by undertaking a particular mode of life. Thus, when a man is initiated he assumes the debt to study, as when a man gets married he assumes the debts to procreate and to offer sacrifices. According to this interpretation, Manu's statement does not contradict other texts that permit a detached man to renounce before he gets married, because before marriage he is not burdened with the debts of procreation and sacrifice. For an extensive discussion of this point, see Olivelle 1993, 177-82,237-43.

48 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism Renunciation When Death Is Imminent 61. Angiras permits itinerant asceticism also for those facing imminent death:28 One who is tired of forest life may depart for the ascetic life after performing the appropriate rite. A twice-born man may renounce if he is afflicted with a disease, if he is detached, or if he has acquired the knowledge of Brahman.

62. A man may depart for the ascetic life while he is vedic student or from home or the forest if he is learned or if he is sick and in great pain.

63. The sage Angiras has ordained renunciation for a man overcome by fear at the sight of a robber, a tiger, and the like or when a dreadful peril is at hand.

64. Śātātapa likewise states: If a man says, "I have renounced," even with his last breath, he will obtain a reward equal to one thousand sacrifices.

65. Dattatreya declares: The practice of carrying the emblem of Visnu is the prerogative of those born from the mouth, and not of those bom from the arms or the thighs.29 66. That ends the second chapter, entitled "Age of Eligibility of a Candidate for Itinerant Asceticism," of the Collection of Ascetic Laws.

28. The term "atura" generally refers to a person who is sick or infirm. Within the context of renunciation, however, it acquires a technical meaning and refers to a person who is in danger of imminent death either through sickness or when attacked by robbers or wild animals. A definition of this term is given at Ch. 4.42. For the procedure of renunciation in such an emergency, see Ch. 4.39-47.

29. The reference is to the cosmogonic hymn of the Ṛgveda (10.90), which por trays the Brahmins as originating from the mouth of the primeval man dismembered in sacrifice and the Ksatriyas and Vaisyas from the arms and the thighs, respectively. The eligibility of non-Brahmins for renunciation is a hotly debated point of medieval Brahmanical theology, a topic, however, that Yadava does not address explicitly.CHAPTER THREE Examination of the Insignia 1. Now we will examine the insignia, which are of two types: the external and the bodily. The bodily insignia consist of the sacrificial string and having the head completely shaved or wearing just a topknot, while the external insignia are the staff, the water pot, and other such items. With reference to external insignia we employ the term "article."1 Bodily Insignia 2. I will first describe the bodily insignia. Vasistha states: and: Wearing a sacrificial string and carrying a water pot in his hand. . . . [VaDh 10,31] Let him be shaven-headed, free from pride and anger, and without possessions. [VaDh 10.6] 3. Yama: He should always sleep on the bare ground and never stay long in the same place. His head shaven and always living in the wilderness, let him turn his mind incessantly to knowledge.

4. Paithīnasi: A sage is homeless and shaven-headed, unselfish and without possessions.

1. The Sanskrit word "matra" is used in ascetic literature as a technical term referring to the external articles, such as garment, staff, and begging bowl, that a renouncer is required to carry. Here the author defines that term as referring only to those articles that constitute the external insignia and not to those, such as the sacrificial string, that are viewed as constituting his bodily insignia. According to this view, the sacrificial string, which is an external article, is viewed as almost a bodily mark like the shaven head.

49 '50 5. Bodhāyana: Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism Going to the wildemess, he should either wear a topknot or have his head completely shaved. (BDh 2.11.17-18].

6. Kratu: After chanting the three hymns-Mind,2 Visnu, and Purusa3-in praise of the Highest Spirit, let him depart from home robed in ocher, carrying a bowl and a staff, and with his head completely shaved or wearing just a topknot.

7. Sumantu A sage is shaven-headed and without possessions.

8. Gautama: He should have his head completely shaved or wear just a topknot.

[GDh 3.21} 9. Consequently, one may choose either to shave the head completely or to wear just a topknot.4 All ascetics without exception, however, are required to wear a sacrificial string. 10. Accordingly, with specific reference to itinerant asceticism, Atri declares: Those Brahmins who, subsisting by sophistry, foolishly discard the sacrificial string sacred to the triple divinity-Brahma, Visṇu, and Śivawill undoubtedly fall both from the path to heaven and from the path to liberation.

11. Uśanas: By discarding his sacrificial string, a Vedic student, a householder, a forest hermit, and even a wandering ascetic will fall. Let no one, therefore, abandon it.

2. The Mind-hymn is probably the same as the Sivasamkalpa (VS 34.1-6; see Ch. 6.64, n. 32), which contains the words tan me manaḥ sivasamkalpam astu. The commentator Mahidhara calls these verses manodevataḥ.

3. The meaning of the expression "vaiṣṇavapaurusa" is unclear. I have taken it to mean hymns connected with Visnu and Puruṣa, the two often being identified in Vaiṣṇava literature. The identity of the three hymns is also unclear. They certainly include the famous Puruṣa hymn (RV 10.90), and perhaps the so-called Viṣṇusukta, which according to Pandit Daulatarama (Nirnayasindhu, Varansi: Thakurprasad & Sons, 1975, p. 1324) consists of the four verses viṣnor nu kam (RV 1.154.1-4), the two verses viṣnoḥ karmani (RV 1.22.19-20), and the two verses trini pada (RV 1.22.18-19; the latter is thus listed twice). A somewhat different version is given in the Suklayajurvediyamādhyandinavajasaneyinām Nityanaimittikakarmasamuccayah (Bombay: Nirnayasagara Press, 1952), p. 411.

4. The reason for the choice is the diversity of opinions given in the authoritative texts cited. See Ch. 2.25 n. 9.

3. Examination of the Insignia External Insignia 12. I will now describe the external insignia. Dakṣa states: A Vedic student is recognized by the girdle, antelope skin, staff, and the like; a householder by the staff, sacrificial broom, and the like; a forest hermit by long nails and hair; and an ascetic by the triple staff. These are their respective marks.

13. Bṛhaspati: After he has thus performed the rite of renunciation, let him take a triple staff tied with a water strainer and reaching up to his hair, as well as a bowl and a water pot.

14. Śankha and Likhita: Abandoning all undertakings," he relies on the use of a triple staff, a water pot, fine thread, and a water strainer, shaves his head, wears ocher clothes, and subsists on begging.

15--16. Angiras: I shall declare the insignia by which an ascetic is recognized: a sacrificial string, a triple staff, a cloth to strain insects, a sling, a begging bowl, a stool, a loincloth, and a waistband. Only a man who possesses these insignia is a true ascetic, and no one else.

17. "Stool" means the "tortoise seat."6 Devala says: The articles consist of an ocher garment, a shaven head, a triple staff, a water pot, a bowl, a water strainer, a pair of sandals, a seat, and a ragged shawl.

18. Gālava: Now, a wandering ascetic bears the insignia; is shaven-headed or wears a topknot, always wears a sacrificial string, and dons a ragged ocher garment. Let him use a cloth to cover his nakedness but not wear an upper garment. He carries a triple staff, a water strainer, a water pot, a bowl, and a ragged shawl.

19. Likhita: Let him wear a ragged shawl and an ocher garb of cotton, bark, antelope skin, Kuśa grass, or hemp.

51 5. The term "undertakings" (ārambha) refers in a special way to ritual activities. The GDh (3.25), for example, calls a renouncer an anarambhin, "one who does not undertake ritual activities." 6. This is a low stool carried by ascetics and used both as an ordinary seat and to sit down while performing ritual purifications. See Ch. 3.79.

7. For the technical meaning of the term "article" (mātrā), see Ch. 3.1 n.1. In spite of that definition of this term, the shaven head is here listed as an article.

152 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 20-21. A sling and a bowl with a lid hung from a tripod,8 a triple staff tied with a water strainer, a round stool, a topknot, a sacrificial string, and also a water pot for use in purifications: whether he is walking or is seated, a pure man should always carry these.

22. Yama: Needle and thread, a tripod, a pair of sandals, a pot, a sling made of string, a begging bowl, a stool, a ragged shawl, a tattered garment, and a staff: this is the short list of articles he should possess.

23. Uśanas: A bowl and its lid, a sling, a triple staff tied with a water strainer, a stool, a waistband, a loincloth, a sacrificial string, and a ragged shawl: let him take these and abandon everything else.

24-25. Kratu: He may carry twenty or ten articles, but he should always carry at least five. The following are the twenty items called articles laid down by the scriptures: ragged shawl, needle, antelope skin, umbrella, water strainer, water pot, stool, bowl, sling, rosary, sacrificial string, spade, a pair of sandals, loincloth, tripod, a pair of shoes, staff, fine thread, yoga band,9 and outer garment.

26. Of these twenty articles, five are obligatory. They are the sacrificial string, triple staff, water strainer, bowl, loincloth, and waistband. 10 27. Visnu, likewise, states: Sacrificial string, triple staff, bowl, water strainer, loincloth, and waistband-one should not abandon these as long as one lives.

8. The sling, which resembles present-day macramé pot-hangers, is tied to the top of the tripod. The bowl is suspended in the sling. When the tripod is set up, the bowl in the sling hangs from its center. The tripod, like a present-day camera tripod, is collapsible. When folded up, it can be held by the bottom, with the top resting on the shoulder and the sling with the bowl hanging behind the shoulder. It appears that in the early period the tripod was used to carry a water pot rather than a begging bowl. For an extended discussion about the triple staff and the tripod, see Olivelle 1986, 42-52, and von Hinūber 1992, 51-67.

9. This is a strip of cloth stitched to form a loop. Iconographic representations. of ascetics show them wearing it around their thighs and the back, thus supporting the legs as they sit on their haunches. Later texts give great prominence to the investiture of an ascetic with the yoga band, presenting it as a type of higher ordination. After this ceremony an ascetic is permitted to teach and to initiate others into the ascetic order. For a description of this rite, see Ypra 66.

10. If the loincloth and waistband are counted as separate items, the list contains six rather than five articles. This anomaly may be why the bowl is omitted in several manuscripts. In all likelihood, however, the loincloth and waistband are counted as a single item, just as the needle and thread are (see Ch. 3.28). That the bowl was originally part of this list is confirmed by the statements that follow (Ch. 3.27-28), 3. Examination of the Insignia 53 53 28. The fact that one takes a bowl necessarily implies that one has to take also its accessories: a sling, a cover, and a tripod. The ten articles are those listed in the scriptural passage beginning "Needle and thread..." [see Ch. 3.22], where we count ten articles by taking the needle and thread as a single item.

29. Now, there are two types of wandering ascetics. The one is devoted to training himself in knowledge and seeks to become proficient in yoga, whereas the other, who has already mastered yoga and knows the truth, lives without visible insignia, keeps his conduct concealed, and although sane, behaves like a madman.11 30. Kratu, likewise, points out the two types: A yogin should go around in the forenoon, while a person who possesses the true knowledge should go around in the afternoon.12 31. Kratu himself makes the following comments with reference to the ascetic who possesses the true knowledge: Virtue, good conduct, learning, knowledge, detachment--that is the definition of the Law. What is the use of articles for a man who has gained complete control of himself?13 32. Meditation, purification, austerity, worship, control of breath, silent prayer, divine praise, twilight worship, begging food, and divine service: he should perform these until death.

33. Even those who possess the true knowledge are without exception required to carry the five articles [see Ch. 3.26], because of the injunction "... should always carry at least five" [see Ch. 3.24] and because of the rule requiring them to beg their food.14 11. This is the stock description of a renouncer at an advanced state of holiness. See VaDh 10.18-19; JU 69.5–6.

12. The reason for the "going around" is to beg (see Ch. 6.98). This is an interesting observation regarding ascetic practice. Brahmanical ascetics are expected to beg late in the afternoon, after the people have finished their meal (see Ch. 6.97-100). Neither Kratu nor Yadava (see Ch. 6.98) reveals the identity of the "yogin." Buddhist monks, however, are not allowed to eat in the afternoon and beg their food in the morning. Kratu's statement may thus be an implicit relegation of Buddhist monks to a lower level of asceticism. It is, however, the only such distinction in the time of begging that I have encountered.

13. The reference is probably to yogic powers, such as the knowledge of previous births and others' thoughts, listed in the Yogasutra (3.16-55).

14. The reasoning here is that the ritual of begging requires the mendicant to be equipped with a begging bowl, a triple staff, and the like. See Ch. 6.151-71.

54 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism Description of the External Insignia 34. In what follows I will describe the specifications of a sacrificial string and the other items on the list of articles.

Sacrificial String I take up first the specifications of a sacrificial string. 35. With special reference to itinerant asceticism, Dattatreya and Atri state: The cotton string should be made by twisting three pieces of thread upward and three pieces downward, with an outer one twisted the same way 15 36. The sacred string of Brahmins, according to scripture, is made of nine pieces of cotton thread divided into three groups of three, with three pieces twisted downward and three twisted upward.

37. Wearing this ninefold string is the means of liberation for twice-born people; without it one is forthwith excluded from all aspects of sacred law.

Staff 38. I will now describe the specifications of a staff. Kapila states: Let him carry one or several bamboo staffs 16 three-fourths of an inch thick, straight, and reaching up to his nose or as tall as himself. 39. Now, they also cite these verses: In this text we define a joint as the spot where one sees fine sprouts with emergent leaves and the middle as what is in-between.

40. They say that an ascetic's staff should be one that does not contain three, five, seven, nine, or eleven joints.17 Below its bottommost joint, moreover, and above its uppermost it should extend one and a half inches.

15. This outer string is also made by twisting three pieces of thread. On the way sacrificial strings are manufactured, see Kane, II, 287f.

16. The plural here probably refers to the triple staff made by tying three bamboos together (see Ch. 3.44-47). The triple staff is preferred by the Vaisnava ascetics. On the controversy regarding the staff, see Olivelle 1986, 56-54.

17. It appears that ascetics avoided staffs with an odd number of joints. Another work recommends staffs with six, eight, ten, twelve, and fourteen joints and gives such staffs respectively the following names: Sudarsana, Nārāyaṇa, Gopala, Vasudeva, and Ananta; see Samnyasāśramapaddhati (Prajña Pathaśālā Library, ms serial no. 4992), folio 33b (see Olivelle 1986, 155 n. 56). It is unclear how universal this attitude was, because a half-verse cited in the PaM (1.2, 157-59) recommends staffs with eleven, nine, seven, four, three, and two joints, and that half-verse is given here in the variant reading of several manuscripts.

3. Examination of the Insignia 55 41. This provision holds good also for householders. Dattatreya states: He should carry three bamboo staffs, each three-quarters of an inch thick, reaching up to top of his head, with their bark intact, unblemished, pleasant, without holes or cracks, and containing six, eight, or ten evenly spaced and unprotruding joints.

42. Dakṣa: An ascetic should carry three bamboo staffs with evenly spaced joints and reaching up to his hair.

43. Dakṣa the Elder: Let a wise man carry a triple staff with a water strainer tied to its top. 44. Hārīta: He should mark off five equal sections on his triple staff and bind it above the third section with a string of black cow's hair to a width of three inches.

45. Containing a series of three knots and with a water strainer tied to its top, he should take it in his right hand while reciting the appropriate mantra when his teacher hands it to him.' 18 46-47. Dakṣa the Elder: He should tie the triple staff with a string at the top and the bottom between the joints. 19 Below the second section from the top20 also he should tie a cow's hair string to a width of three inches. Or else he may mark off five equal sections and tie it five times with a string. 48-49. In the Pancarātra text Tattvasāgarasam hitā it is stated:21 Let an ascetic think of the top section of the triple staff as Parameṣṭhin, the second section as Puruṣātman, the mid-section as Viśvātman, the fourth 18. For the mantra that is recited when a new ascetic formally takes up his staff, see Ch. 4.19, 38. The knots that tie the three bamboos are called mudrā (the term usually used for hand gestures with mystic significance) and given different symbolic values. Often, five such knots or mudras along the staff are mentioned (see Ch. 3.46- 47), relating to serpent, cow, ax, conch, and Brahma. For an account of these mudras, see Ypra 35.7-29.

19. I have translated madhye as "between the joints" in the light of the statement made above at Ch. 3.39. If it means simply "in the middle," the translation would be "at the top, the bottom, and the middle." My interpretation is more likely, since the middle binding is referred to in the next half-verse.

20. As stated at Ch. 3.44, one marks off five equal sections. The middle binding is done just below the second from the top, i.c., at the beginning of the third section.

21. Contrary to his opening remark that he limits himself to Dharmasastric texts (Ch. 1.10), Yadava here cites from a Pañcaratra text. Smith does not list the Tattvasagarasam hita among the extant texts, although it is found in a couple of ancient lists of Pancaratra texts; see Smith 1975, 243, 262.

56 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism section as Nivrttipuruṣa, and the fifth section as Sarvātman.22 Let him envisage the triple staff in its entirety as an image of Visṇu.

50. Hārīta: An ascetic should carry at all times the image of Visnu that is called the triple staff.

51. Śaunaka: The short is the staff of knowledge, the medium is the staff of the self, and the long is the staff of Visnu-let an ascetic carry the triple staff.23 52. Pracetas: An ascetic should carry the sacred string and the triple staff by himself, just as he does the topknot. If he gets someone else to carry them, he should undergo the following penance.

53. After sprinkling the triple staff with water as he recites the Purusa hymn and the seven verses to Visnu,24 he should control his breath one hundred times.

54. Let him place his staff near by25 when he bathes, when he answers the calls of nature, when he eats, when he engages in silent prayer and private vedic recitation, and when he sleeps.

55. An ascetic should always take with him a triple staff, as well as a single bamboo staff to carry articles such as the loincloth and the waistband.

56. If an ascetic voids urine or excrement while holding the triple staff, to restore purity he should perform the rite of sipping water with the staff in his hand.26 57. Jābāli the Elder: 22. In Vaiṣṇava theology, these are names given to different aspects of the supreme god Visnu.

23. It is unclear whether the author is referring to triple staffs themselves or to the three bamboos that constitute a triple staff (the variant tridandan, "three staffs," in ms A4 appears to support the latter). If it is the latter, then one of the three must have been long, one of medium length, and one short. I have not encountered any other reference to such a distinction in lengths either of the bamboos or of staffs themselves, although sources specify various lengths, such as reaching the nose or hair or being as tall as one's body.

24. The Puruṣa hymn is RV 10.90. The seven verses to Visṇu may be the same as the hymn to Visṇu: see Ch. 3.6 n. 3.

25. I am not quite sure of the exact meaning of the expression "upa dandena bandhayer," which I assume to mean that he should place the triple staff near him when he engages in these activities, as indicated in Ch. 8.23.

26. The wording makes it unclear whether the purification is intended for the staff, for the ascetic, or for both.

3. Examination of the Insignia 57 After filling his cupped hands with water and pouring it down, and taking one or [three] staffs....2 58. Bodhāyana: 27 And thereafter he should not wear a white garment. He may carry a single or a triple staff. [BDh 2.17.44-18.1] 59. Yajnavalkya: Or he may carry a single such staff, in which case it should not be tied with a cow's hair string.

60. One has a choice, therefore, with regard to the type of staff one carries. Yet, both because it entails a greater effort and because it is mentioned in a larger number of texts, carrying a triple staff is more praiseworthy than carrying a single staff. 61. This position is supported by the Blessed Vyasa: Carrying a triple staff is commended, and likewise living in solitude, eating little, and living without worries. For ascetics these are the means to liberation.

62. This difference in the type of staff does not entail corresponding differences with regard to either the other articles or duties such as twilight worship. Some texts, on the other hand, prescribe a single staff when the triple staff is damaged.28 63. Atri and Jābāla state: When the water strainer or the triple staff is inadvertently damaged, he should take a single bamboo staff or, as an inferior alternative, a Palāśa staff.

64. When even these are not available, let him go around carrying a Palāśa leaf or a tuft of Kusa grass until he obtains a better staff.29 65. Hārīta: When the water strainer or the triple staff is inadvertently damaged, he should take a single bamboo staff or, as an inferior alternative, a Palāśa staff and proceed until he obtains a triple staff.

27. Only the first words of this citation are given. I have been unable to trace the rest of the passage. See Ch. 2.37 n. 16.

28. The Sanskrit term "nasta" has several shades of meaning, including damaged, lost, spoiled, and corrupted. All these may be intended here. A renouncer is expected to throw into water a staff that is broken or damaged, as well as one that has come into contact with impurities, such as liquor, urine, excrement, and blood. A staff is likewise to be abandoned when the water strainer normally tied to its top is similarly damaged. See Ch. 8.24-31; Ypra 68.78-80.

29. Palāśa is the tree Butea frondosa, and Kusa is a type of grass (Poa cynosuroides) used for ritual purposes.

58 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 66. Ever vigilant and composed, he should vigorously search for a triple staff, and when he finds one, he should take it, after tying a water strainer to its top.

67. Medhātithi: As long as he does not have three staffs, he may go around with one. Even then he should tie a water strainer to its top for use in purifying water. 68. Jamadagni: Pot Let him never tie a loincloth or a waistband to the triple staff. By foolishly tying them to it, one shows disrespect to the triple staff.

69. If a mendicant carelessly lets his triple staff come into contact with the other staff,30 he should wash the triple staff with earth and water and control his breath three times.

70. In the age of Kali one should not carry a pot. Accordingly, Devala states: In the Dvapara and similar ages an ascetic may eat from a begging bowl. In the Kali age, however, he should never eat directly from his begging bowl, nor should he carry a pot.31 Water Strainer 71-72. Medhātithi gives the specifications of a water strainer: One should understand that a water strainer should be smooth, 32 white, and untouched; that it should be nine inches long on both sides, or two or three times that long, or six inches long on all sides, or a full span; that it should be without holes, soft, and made of cotton; and that it should not be made by an outcaste or a similar person.

30. The other staff refers to the pole used to carry an ascetic's personal belongings (see Ch. 3.20-21 n. 8 and 3.55). Coming into contact with the loincloth and other impure articles renders it impure. The purity of the triple staff is indicated by its contact with the water strainer.

31. As we shall see in Ch. 6.206, a renouncer begs food in a begging bowl but transfers it into a different dish, often a leaf, when he eats. The meaning of "pot" (kundika) and the significance of its prohibition are unclear. It must be something different from the water pot (kamandalu) that ascetics are required to carry. At Ch. 3.22, however, the kundika is listed among the ten articles an ascetic should carry, and this term has given the Kundika Upaniṣad its title. For further details, see Sprockhoff 1976, 44-46, and von Hinūber 1992, 51-67..

32. The meaning of the term "vikesa" in this context is unclear. I have taken it to mean a piece of cloth that is not shaggy. It may also mean "without hair," that is, without hair sticking to it, but since the term is listed under specifications, this meaning seems less likely.3. Examination of the Insignia The term "untouched" means not previously used. 73. Angiras states: There are only three white things that ascetics always have: sacrificial string, teeth, and a cloth to strain insects.

Begging Bowl 74. Atri describes the bowls: A bowl may be made of clay, wood, bottle-gourd, bamboo, thread, stone, grass, or linen, or it may be a funnel fashioned out of a leaf.

75. He should take one of these according to his ability. If he thereafter takes a different bowl out of greed, he should control his breath ten times. 76. Kratu: One should take a bowl made of bamboo, wood, stone, bottle-gourd, grass, leaves, clay, or linen, according to one's ability.

77. Manu: Manu, the son of Svayambhu, has declared that bowls made of bottlegourd, wood, clay, and bamboo are suitable for ascetics. [MDh 6.54] Sling 78. Hārīta gives the specifications of a sling: These are the specifications of a sling. It is made by knotting linen strips, Kuśa fibers, or cotton strings and is shaped like a lotus, with five or six sections.33 Seat 79. The same author gives the specifications of a seat: It is laid down that the seat of an ascetic should be round and equipped with a handle and that it should be made of wood. Sages in ancient times created it both for purification and for sitting down.

Spade 80. Kapila gives the specifications of a spade: There is no fault in having a three-inch spade for digging the earth.

81. That ends the third chapter, entitled "Examination of the Insignia," of the Collection of Ascetic Laws.

59 33. The term "muṣti" (lit., "clenched fist") here probably refers to the sections of a sling; see Ch. 3.20-21 n. 8 and Ypra 8.9-11.

CHAPTER FOUR The Procedure of Renunciation 1. I will now describe the procedure of renunciation, explaining at the outset the procedure given by Saunaka. In the course of this explanation I will point out at the appropriate places certain indispensable details of the procedure not found in Saunaka but given elsewhere. 2. Katyayana gives its preliminary rites: People living outside the orders of life should perform four Krechra penances, while those living within an order should perform a single Krechra penance. In this manner one becomes fit for renunciation. On the twelfth day of the bright fortnight or on the full moon, he should announce his intention2 and get his head shaved. He should then perform the Śrāddha oblations-first to the gods, second to the seers, third to the divine beings, fourth to the male ancestors, fifth to the female ancestors, sixth to human beings, seventh to the elements, and eighth to the self.3 3. Blessed Vasistha the Elder says the same thing, with an identical statement beginning with "on the full moon day."4 4. Saunaka states: 1. Those living outside the four orders of life are people such as bachelors who have completed their Vedic studentship and widowers. Four Krechra penances constitute what is technically known as a Prajapatya penance (see MDh 11.211; YDh 3.319). It consists of taking one meal a day for six days-a morning meal the first three days and an evening meal the second-eating what is received unasked during the next three days, and fasting during the last three. See GDh 26.1-5; ApDh 1.27.7; BDh 2.2.38; 4.5.6. A single Krechra penance is a quarter of the Prājāpatya, that is, doing the same four austerities for only one day each. Such a penance is called padakṛechra ("quarter penance") at YDh 3.318. Regarding the "hot penance" (taptakṛechra) that some sources prescribe here, see Ch. 10.44 n. 9, and my translation of Ypra 6.2-3n.

2. This is the formal and open declaration that he will perform the rite of renunciation. Such a formal declaration is a prerequisite of all Brahmanical rites.

3. For a detailed procedure of these oblations, see Ypra 7 and Sp 3-4. Śraddha oblations are generally funerary offering made to deceased ancestors. Here these oblations are extended to other inhabitants of the universe.

4. The author appears to be saying that Vasistha the Elder gives the same procedure and that his text reproduces verbatim the section of Katyayana's text beginning with "on the full moon day." 60 4. The Procedure of Renunciation On the day preceding the rite of renunciation, he should offer a Sraddha oblation to the ancestors with happy faces and feed the invited Brahmins. Then he should get them to announce that the day is auspicious and to proclaim success and prosperity, after which he should get his hair and beard shaved and his nails clipped.

5. Blessed Jamadagnya also speaks to this: He should get his hair and beard shaved and his nails clipped. 6. Saunaka: Then he should bathe in the prescribed manner and give away all his possessions with the exception of things required for the sacrifice and other similar rites.6 7. Bodhāyana: Staffs, sling, water pot, water strainer, and bowl: taking these....7 8. Vasistha: Triple staff, seat, ragged shawl, sling, bowl, and water pot-a wise man should take these six and abandon other possessions.

9. He is enjoined to cleanse his impurities and to get rid of his possessions. One should never admit to renunciation man who has not for- saken his sons and his wealth.

10. Kātyāyana: Triple staff, water strainer, sling, bowl, loincloth, and ocher garment-he should place these in front of the fire; a man without a sacred fire should set one up.

11. Bodhāyana: A man without a sacred fire is to set one up and to follow the procedure prescribed for a person with a single fire.8 61 5. Ancestors with happy faces (nāndīmukha) are those beyond the three most recently deceased forefathers, namely, the father, paternal grandfather, and paternal great-grandfather. These three are called "teary-faced" (aśrumukha). Oblations to the former ancestors are offered on auspicious occasions, such as a birth or a marriage, and follow a somewhat different procedure. See Ypra 7.3-4n, 7.5n.

6. As part of the renunciatory rite, the candidate offers a final sacrifice to Prajapati or to Agni Vaiśvānara and gives gifts to the officiating priests; see Ch. 4.26, 28.

7. The rest of Bodhayana's statement reads: "he should go to the outskirts of the village, to the village boundary, or to a fire stall, cat the triple mixture of ghee, milk, and curd, and observe a fast" (BDh 2.17.11-12.).

8. A person with a single fire maintains the domestic fire called avasathya and performs all the rites in that fire. He is distinguished from a man who maintains the three Vedic fires, who is called ahitagni. These fires are the east fire (ahavaniya), householder's or west fire (garhapatya), and south fire (anvāhāryapacana). Some sources list five fires, adding a hall fire (sabhya) and domestic fire (avasathya or aupasana). See Ypra 7.30-49; 10.5. The modifications of the renunciatory ritual for people without a fire and for those with the three Vedic fires are given in Sp 16-17.

62 12. Śaunaka: Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism Then, after getting together the staff and the other articles, he should go to a temple, to the village boundary, to the outskirts of the village, to the bank of a river, or to a holy place, and, joining his hands in prayer, he should silently recite: Homage to Brahman! Homage to Indra! Homage to the Sun! Homage to the Self! He should then sip some water and, taking some sacred Darbha grass in his folded hands, silently recite the Vedas and the like. Then he eats a handful of barley meal and sips some water. Next, he should consecrate the region of his navel with this mantra: To the self, svaha! To the inner self, svaha! To Prajapati, svāhā! Then he should eat the triple mixture of milk, curd, and ghee, sip some water, and observe a fast. Or else he may drink some water. And he should silently recite: OM Earth, I enter Sāvitrī. That excellent [glory] of Savitr OM Atmosphere, I enter Savitri. The glory of god we meditate. OM Heaven, I enter Sāvitrī. That he may stimulate our prayers.! OM Earth, I enter Sāvitrī. That excellent glory of Savitr, the god, we meditate.

OM Atmosphere, I enter Sāvitrī. That he may stimulate our prayers. OM Heaven, I enter Sāvitrī. That excellent glory of Savitr, the god, we meditate, that he may stimulate our prayers.

OM Earth, Atmosphere, Heaven, I enter Savitri. That excellent glory of Savitr, the god, we meditate, that he may stimulate our prayers. [RV 3.62.10] It is acknowledged that a person thus betakes himself to another order of life and becomes one with Brahman. Thus they quote: Having gone from one order of life to another, a man who has offered sacrifices and subdued his senses becomes a mendicant when he gets tired of giving alms and offering oblations.

Such a mendicant, indeed, is fit for immortality.

13. Śaunaka: Then, before sunset, he should melt some butter, strain it, and offer four ladlefuls in the blazing fire, saying, "OM svāhā!" He then performs the evening fire sacrifice, spreads some grass to the north of the fire, places the vessels on that grass, spreads some sacred Darbha grass to the south of the 9. All the manuscripts have the reading grame ("in the village"), but I think the intention is to indicate a place removed from the village. In most similar contexts. sources use the word gramante ("at the boundary of a village").

10. The candidate here internalizes the Gayatri verse by first reciting each of its three feet separately. Given the difference in the syntax, it is impossible to accurately reproduce the three feet separately in English.

4. The Procedure of Renunciation fire at the seat of the Brahman priest," covers them with a black antelope skin, and, sitting there, keeps awake that night, Rising at the hour sacred to Brahman,12 he bathes according to the rule and performs the morning fire sacrifice. Then, after reciting the Great Utterances,13 he should stand in the middle of the water and recite softly the hymn "Swift runs this giver of delight" [RV 9.58]. Thereafter, he gratifies some Brahmins with food, gets them to announce that the day is auspicious and to proclaim success and prosperity, adds fuel to the fire, and makes an offering of ghee, saying, To the in-breath, svāhā! To the out-breath, svāhā! To the diffused breath, svāhā! To the up-breath, svāhā! To the middle breath, svāhā! After that, as he recites the Puruṣa hymn [RV 10.90], he offers a piece of firewood, ghee, and porridge14 at each verse. Then, after silently reciting the Purusa hymn and arranging the goblet of holy water, he offers the oblation to Agni Sviṣṭakṛt. 15 He offers according to his wish the oblations Jaya and the like to Agni Sviṣṭakṛt. 16 He should then present to his teacher a cow, gold, and a bowl of ghee, as well as anything else that he might be inclined to give, and pay his respects to the teacher, saying, "May the Maruts pour down on me..." [TA 2.18.1]. Thereupon, he should deposit the fires in himself, saying, "Come, O fire, with that body of yours worthy of sacrifice..." [TB 2.5.8.8]. Then, standing before the fire or in water, he recites three times softly, three times in a medium voice, and three time aloud, OM Earth, Atmosphere, Heaven! I have renounced! Facing the east, then, he fills his cupped hands with water and pours it down, as he says: I grant safety to all being! 63 14. Likewise, Bodhāyana also, after giving the passage beginning with "OM Earth, Atmosphere, Heaven! I have renounced!" until "pours it down," goes on to say: 11. At Vedic sacrifices this priest sits silently to the south of the east fire and rectifies any errors committed by the other priests.

12. This is the period from first light to sunrise; see Ypra 8.34-35n.

13. The Great Utterances (vyahṛti) are either three (bhūḥ, bhuvaḥ, svaḥ) or seven (with the addition of the four other worlds: mahar, janas, tapas, and satya).

14. The porridge (caru) is made by boiling rice and barley in milk.

15. This is the aspect of the fire god that "makes a sacrifice properly offered," i.e., it makes the sacrifice successful and fruitful. This oblation is offered at the conclusion of every sacrifice.

16. Three supplementary oblations called Jaya, Rastrabhṛt, and Abhyatana may be offered by a sacrificer to obtain specific desires, such as success. See TS 3.4.6.2 and Sabara's commentary on the PMS 3.4.9.25. For a description of the rites, see Śrautakosa, English Section, I.1, pp. 201-205. The reading of this and the previous sentence, as one can see from the variants given in the critical edition, is quite uncertain.

64 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism No being will ever pose a danger to a sage who wanders after he has given safety to all beings. [BDh 2.17.27-30] 15. Vasistha the Elder: When, according to the sequence of tone,17 a man utters three times the words "I have renounced," by that very renunciation he frees forthwith from hell thirty generations of forefathers before him and a further thirty beyond them, as well as thirty generations that will come after him.

16. For, when it sees a twice-born man who has renounced, the sun swerves from its place, thinking, "This man will split my orb and proceed to the highest Brahman."18 17. If a learned Brahmin who has become detached and who has a desire to enter the renouncer's order happens to die, he will never again come into being, irrespective of the order in which he lived. 19 18. The same author states: A man who has not maintained the three Vedic fires (see Ch. 4.11 n. 8), as well as a widower, should perform the rite of renunciation in this manner. 19. Śaunaka: He then takes the ocher garment, saying, "Well-dressed and covered has come the youthful one..." [RV 3.8.41; the triple staff, saying, "Friend, protect me"; and the sacrificial string, with the words "That health and wellbeing we choose..." [TS 2.6.10.2). He takes the sling, saying, "May that bright light born beyond this atmosphere..." [TS 4.2.5.21; the bowl, saying, "OM"; the water strainer with the words "The purifier with which the gods ever cleanse themselves..." [TB 1.4.8.6]; and the water pot with the words "The light by which the gods rose up..." [TS 5.7.2.2].

20. Katyayana, on the other hand, states: He takes the bowl, reciting the seven Great Utterances.

21. Vasistha: He takes the sacrificial string, saying: "Wear the white sacrificial string ..." [PG 2.2.10; BU 851,20 and the five items beginning with the triple staff with the mantras "The swan seated in purity..." [RV 4.40.5], "His rays lift it up high for all to see..." [RV 1.50.11, "The splendid face of the gods has risen..." [RV 1.115.11, "That bright eye, divinely ordained..." [RV 7.66.16], and "Homage to Mitra's and Varuna's eye..." [RV 10.37.1]. He 17. That is, in a soft, medium, and loud voice; see Ch. 4.13.

18. The belief that the sun, and sometimes the moon, acted like a door shutting off this world from the immortal world beyond is expressed in several Upanisads: BaU 6.2.15; ChU 5.10.1; KauU 1.2.

19. The syntax is problematic, but the meaning appears to be that he will not be reborn in samsara even if he were to die before he could actually become a renouncer. 20. Since only the first word of this verse (yajñopavitam) is given, I cannot be absolutely sure that this is the intended verse. For another formula with the same first word and coming directing after this in the PG 2.2.10, see Ch. 4.27 below.

4. The Procedure of Renunciation should then worship the fire with the mantra "Member by member, joint by joint..." [RV 10.97.12] and discard the fire with the two mantras beginning with "Set ablaze. . . ." [RV 6.15.7]. He should then go to the outskirts of the village and take the three staffs with the words "The bull roars aloud, bound with a triple bond" [RV 4.58.3]. After silently reciting the four purificatory verses and the triple prayer,21 he should take three steps, saying, "Three steps did Viṣṇu take . . ." [RV 1.22.18]. After worshipping with the formula "That highest step of Viṣṇu . . ." [RV 1.22.20], he should softly recite "You are self-existent. . ." [VS 2.26]. He should then give safety to all living beings-to the creatures of the water such as fish and to animals on land such as cattle, deer, and reptiles-and thereafter refrain from picking flowers, roots, and fruits, from cutting trees, from honey, meat, and falsehood, and from giving and taking. 22. Katyāyana states: Abandoning his own village and relatives, he should go to another village and devote himself to silent prayer and meditation. He may subsist on almsfood that he solicits or receives unasked. He should avoid love, anger, lust, and hatred. Living in this manner all his life, he attains Brahman and is not reborn.

23. Śaunaka: Then, without looking around and in silence, he should walk toward the east or the north. He should zealously cultivate tranquillity, self-control, and similar virtues. He should engage in study, reflection, and meditation and always recite the syllable OM.

24. That concludes the procedure of renunciation given by Saunaka.

25. Kapila states: A man who has not maintained a sacred fire, however, after shaving his head completely or wearing just a topknot, should fast a day and a night, take a bath, and with his hand offer some water into the water, saying, Waters indeed are all the gods. I offer to all the gods, svāhā! I have risen above the desire for sons, the desire for wealth, and the desire for worlds, svāhā! Then he says three times softly, three times in a medium voice, and three times aloud: OM Earth, Atmosphere, Heaven! I have renounced! For it is said that gods are triply true [see BDh 2.17.28.]. Then he fills his cupped hands with water and pours it on the ground, saying, Safety from me to all creatures, svāhā! 65 21. The Sanskrit is unclear. It may also mean "the fourfold and triple purificatory verse." In any case, I am not sure what the four verses are. The triple verse (trika) is the syllable OM, the three great utterances, and the Gayatri verse. See Ch. 5.82.

'66 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism He then takes one or more staffs (see Ch. 3.38 n. 16), a water strainer, a water pot, a sling, and a bowl and, in the presence of the fire, forsakes his sons, friends, enemies, and relatives.

26. Vasistha the Elder states: Now, a man who has maintained the three Vedic fires should rise at dawn and make one of the following sacrifices using rice and barley: Vaiśvānarī, Pathikṛti, or Tantumati.22 Then, going up to the east fire, he should offer in it the sacrificial vessels, 23 saying, "To the heavenly world, svāhā!" and deposit that fire in himself, reciting the mantra "This is your proper womb ..." [TS 1.5.5.2]. Then, going up to the south fire, he should offer in it the mortar and pestle, saying, "This Agni in the land is rich..." [vs 3.40), and deposit that fire, reciting the mantra "This is your proper womb..." [TS 1.5.5.2]. Then, going up to the householder's fire, he should offer in it the fire drill, saying, "He is the householder, this Agni of the householder ..." [VS 3.39], and deposit that fire, reciting the mantra "This is your proper womb..." (TS 1.5.5.2]. Standing in the middle of the altar, then, he should silently recite the hymn "A thousand heads has Puruṣa... [RV 10.90] and offer worship with the mantra "From the waters he was born ..." (TA 3.13.11.24 He should then worship the self, saying, "I know this great Purusa..." ITA 3.13.1], and offer rice balls to his ancestors in the following manner: In the eastern direction: "May my ancestors together with Indra become sated." After worshipping them with the mantra "Indra the rescuer..." [RV 6.47.11), he should offer the rice balls to his ancestors.

In the south-eastern direction: "May my ancestors together with Agni become sated." After worshipping them with the mantra "Agni is the head ..." [RV 8.44.16], he should offer the rice balls to his ancestors.

In the southern direction: "May my ancestors together with Yama become sated." After worshipping them with the mantra "You are Yama "(RV 1.163.3), he should offer the rice balls to his ancestors.

In the south-western direction: "May my ancestors together with Nirrti become sated." After worshipping them with the mantra "This is your share, Nirrti..." [TS 1.8.1.1), he should offer the rice balls to his ancestors.

22. Vaiśvānari is an offering to Agni "present in all men." This is the sacrifice normally enjoined prior to renunciation. A detailed description of it is given in Sp 16. Pathikṛti is an offering to Agni, "who prepares the way." It is prescribed as a penance for one who has neglected to offer the full-moon and new-moon sacrifices (MK 5.2430; Rudradatta, commenting on ApSr 9.8.5). Tantumati is an offering to Agni Tantumat (probably meaning "uninterrupted like a thread"), again recommended as an expiation for neglecting ritual obligations (SanGr 5.4.1-2).

23. Other sources specify that he should throw in the fire only the wooden utensils. Those made of stone or metal are given away to the priests.

24. This is the beginning of the so-called Uttaranarayana hymn, which gets its name from the fact that it follows the Purusa (here identified with Nārāyaṇa) hymn both in the VS (31.17) and in the TA.

4. The Procedure of Renunciation In the western direction: "May my ancestors together with Varuna become sated." After worshipping them with the mantra "A broad path indeed has Varuna made. . ." [RV 1.24.8], he should offer the rice balls to his ancestors.

In the north-western direction: "May my ancestors together with Vayu become sated." After worshipping them with the mantra "A hundred horses, O Vayu,..." [RV 4.48.5], he should offer the rice balls to his ancestors.

In the northern direction: "May my ancestors together with Soma become sated." After worshipping them with the mantra "King Soma..." [VS 19.72], he should offer the rice balls to his ancestors.

In the north-eastern direction: "May my ancestors together with Iśāna become sated." After worshipping them with the mantra "Lord of this world..." [RV 7.32.22], he should offer the rice balls to his ancestors.

In the direction of the zenith: "May my ancestors together with Brahmā become sated." After worshipping them with the mantra "Brahman of old was born in the east..." [TS 4.2.8.2], he should offer the rice balls to his ancestors.

67 In the direction of the nadir: "May my ancestors together with the snakes become sated." After worshipping them with the mantra "Homage to the snakes..." [TS 4.2.8.3], he should offer the rice balls to his ancestors. 27. After completing the offering of rice balls, he tells his relatives, "Give your approval," and takes a hundred blades of sacred Darbha grass. The rest of the procedure should be gathered from Saunaka's statement beginning "You are the sacrificial string . . .” [PG 2.2.10].25 28. Kapila mentions a special feature applicable only in the case of a man who has maintained the three Vedic fires: If he has maintained the three Vedic fires, he should perform a sacrifice to Prajapati at which he gives all his possessions as a sacrificial gift to the priests. He should then deposit the fires in himself, reciting the mantra "This is your proper womb..." [TS 1.5.5.2], and, standing in the middle of the altar, contemplate Visṇu, the god Nārāyaṇa, carrying a conch, discus, and mace, robed in yellow, and wearing a crown, bracelet, and earring. Receiving his teacher's permission, then, he should recite the Praiṣa mantra.26 25. This passage of Saunaka is not given by Yadava, but must have been known to his readers for him to mention only its beginning. A passage with a similar beginning is given at Ch. 4.21 but ascribed there to Vasistha.

26. Praisa is the technical term for the mantra "I have renounced," which is considered to be the essential element of the renunciatory rite (Olivelle 1975).

68 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 29. Jamadagnya: A twice-born man who is free from debt may undertake the rite of renunciation after reciting for twelve days the hymn "Order and truth... and learning the meaning of the Vedas in the prescribed manner.

30. He should get his hair and beard shaved and in silence observe a fast at a holy place of water, keeping awake that night of the changing moon.28 31. He should perform a sacrifice to Prajapati at which he gives all his possessions as a sacrificial gift to the priests and deposit the fires in himself, reciting the verse "Come, O Agni, with that body of yours worthy of sacrifice..." [TB 2.5.8.8).

32. The Brahmin should stand within the sacrificial enclosure and recite "I am the mover of the tree..." [TU 1.10.1]. The Veda is really the tree of Brahman. He becomes fit for Brahman.

33. The son or the pupil is admonished: "Speak the truth (TU 1.11.1). One should never seek to obtain almsfood by giving advice or taking part in debates."29 34. He says three times softly, three times in a medium voice, and three time aloud, "OM Earth, Atmosphere, Heaven! I have renounced." For the exponents of the Veda declare that gods are triply true.

35. The ascetic should then take the triple staff, saying, "Three steps did Visṇu take..." [RV 1.22.18], and, if he is wise, he should take as well the staffs of mind, speech, and body, 30 36. "Agni is the divinity, and Gayatri is the meter": with this mantra31 the twice-born mendicant should take a bowl made of bottle-gourd or wood. He should take the water strainer with the verse "With the golden strainer sacred to Prajapati..." [TB 1.8.6]. A sage should be equipped with a strainer and drink water purified with it.

27. This is the Aghamarṣaṇa hymn (RV 10.190) recited to remove sins. See MNU 143-48, together with Varenne's note there, and Ch. 6.34 n. 16.

28. The term parvan refers to the days of the full and new moon, as well as to the eighth and fourteenth days of the lunar fortnight. However, most sources recommend that the rite of renunciation be performed on the full moon. "Place of water" refers to any body of water that one can enter to bathe, such as a lake, river, or tank.

29. The verse is somewhat unclear. It is unlikely that these words would be spoken by the man undergoing the initiation It is more likely that they are addressed to him by his father or teacher. I have included the second half of the verse as part of the instruction. If it stands outside, it would be quite out of place within the context. The second half of the verse is found also in VaDh 10.21 and MDh 6.50 (see Ch. 7.8).

30. This is a common allegory of the three staffs of an ascetic. The Sanskrit term "danda" ("rod") can mean staff, rod, punishment, and restraint. The control of one's mind, speech, and body are thus considered the true triple staff.

31. I am not altogether sure about this reading. Generally, one announces the divinity, the meter, and the seer connected with a particular mantra, but that announcement itself is not regarded as a mantra. In Ch. 4.19 the mantra at the taking of the bowl is OM.4. The Procedure of Renunciation 37. No being will ever pose a danger to a man who gives the gift of safety as he pours water from his cupped hands, saying, "To all beings, svāhā!" 38. Going silently toward the east or the north of the village, he should bathe in the prescribed manner and control his breath six times.

69 39. He then offers the sacrificial string in water with the words "Earth, svāhā!" and takes the triple staff, saying, "Friend, protect me." In the Supplement there is a statement enjoining the disposal of the sacrificial string worn previously,32 Renunciation When Death Is Imminent 40. We will describe next the procedure of renunciation at a time of imminent death [see Ch. 2.61 n. 28]. 41. With reference to this, Jābāli states: If a man is in mortal danger, he may renounce orally or mentally. This path has been prescribed here for Brahmins. [JU 68-69] 42. Angiras: There is an exception in the case of those who are in moral danger: they need not follow the normal procedure or perform any rites. The rule for people in mortal danger is that they can renounce by merely reciting the Praisa [see Ch. 4.28 n. 26].

43. Likhita: When a man is about to be killed by a tiger, fire, a robber, or a snake, or when a man suffering from a serious sickness wishes to die, he should take to renunciation either following or disregarding the normal procedure.

44. If a man says "I have renounced," even with his last breath, he will rescue his forefathers and place himself on the path to liberation.

45. After he has thus renounced, the twice-born man who reverts to lay life when the danger of death has passed, as well as those who maintain social contact with such a man-all of them become outcastes by their actions. No expiation is possible for such people.

32. It is unclear which supplement Yadava means. The Vaisnava tradition that required its renouncers to wear a sacrificial string interpreted scriptural statements enjoining its abandonment as referring to the sacrificial string worn previously while the renouncer was a householder or a student. Such a text is cited anonymously in the Yls 1.50-58 (Olivelle 1987, 59-60): "Having clipped his nails, he should discard the old sacrificial string, garment, and water pot, and, taking new ones, enter the renouncer's order." The implication is that the candidate takes a new sacrificial string at his renunciatory rite. For the controversy concerning the sacrificial string, see Olivelle 1986-87.

170 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 46. After he has thus renounced, if the danger of death passes, he should receive in the presence of the teacher the triple staff and other articles while reciting the appropriate mantras. And taking them, he should engage in the practice of yoga.

47. When any of these articles is damaged (see Ch. 3.62 n. 28] and he finds a new one, he should take it himself while reciting the appropriate mantra. He should throw the damaged ones in water, saying, "Go to the ocean, svāhā!" And he should learn the laws pertaining to ascetics-that is the teaching of Likhita.

48. Three methods of renouncing are given for people in danger of death, according to the statement "... either following or disregarding the procedure" [see Ch. 4.42]. The proper procedure should be followed if a person is somehow able to perform it. If he is unable, he should recite orally just the Praisa: "I have renounced." If he is unable even to do that, he should just mentally abandon attachments. That concludes the procedure of renunciation at a time of imminent death.

49. That ends the fourth chapter, entitled "The Procedure of Renunciation," of the Collection of Ascetic Laws.

CHAPTER FIVE Principal Activities 1. Next I will discuss the principal activities of ascetics. 2. In this connection, Uśanas writes: There are two kinds of vedic students, according to the scriptures: the temporary and the permanent; and likewise, two kinds of hermits: those who take their wives with them and those who leave their wives behind. 3. Mendicants likewise are of two types: mendicant renouncers and renouncers who abandon vedic rites; while there are numerous divisions of householders, such as Sālīna.' 4. Manu has declared only a twofold division of people belonging to the four orders of life. Out of these, listen now to the description of a mendicant renouncer.

5. When a twice-born man becomes detached from the pleasures of this world and the next, he may depart for the ascetic life after offering a sacrifice to Agni Vaiśvānara at which he gives all his possessions to the priests as their sacrificial fee [see Ch. 4.25 n. 22].

6. So, on the twofold division of wandering ascetics there is agreement. 7. Some, nevertheless, report a fourfold division: There are four kinds of mendicants: Kuṭīcaka, Bahudaka, Hamsa, and Paramahamsa, listed in an ascending order of eminence.

8. Others, however, claim that this division is authorized not by the Vedas but by the texts of Pañcarātra and Samkhya.2 9. And Apastamba refutes that view:3 1. For an extensive discussion of the various classifications of these four institutions, see Olivelle 1993, 161-73.

2. In Yadava's eyes, these texts were clearly inferior and could not be completely trusted. See his opening comments (Ch. 1.10) that his treatise is based solely on the Dharmasastras and not on the Epics and Puranas.

3. It is not altogether clear what that view is. I think that Yadava is firmly opposed to the fourfold division given above, not so much because it contains four 71 • 72 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism Some require him to go completely naked. Abandoning truth and falsehood, pleasure and pain, the Vedas, this world and the next, he should seek his self. When he comes to know it, he attains liberation.

That is forbidden by the sacred texts. Moreover, if a man attains liberation upon knowing it, then he would not experience pain even in this life. This explains what follows.4 [ApDh 2.21.12-17] 10. Atri: Some mendicants, the Vedas note, wear topknots, while others have their heads completely shaved. There are four kinds of Brahmin mendicants, but all of them carry triple staffs.

11. Parāśara: Now, there are four kinds of wandering ascetics: Kuticaka, Bahudaka, Hamsa, and Paramahamsa. Of these, Kuticakas are those who get a son of theirs or a similar person to build them a hut; give up lust, anger, greed, delusion, pride, envy, and the like; and renounce in the prescribed manner. They carry a triple staff and a water strainer, wear an ocher garment, and devote themselves to bathing, purification, sipping, silent prayer, private vedic recitation, chastity, and meditation. At the time for begging, they obtain food only from a son of theirs or from a similar person just sufficient to sustain life and always dwell in that hut. Thus they liberate themselves.

Bahūdakas are those who carry a triple staff, a water pot, a water strainer made of fine thread, and a sling, and wear an ocher garment. They explain the meaning of the Vedantas and beg almsfood from virtuous Brahmins. Thus they liberate themselves.

Hamsas are those who carry a triple staff, a water strainer, and a sling and wear a sacrificial string. They consume cow's urine and cow dung and observe vows such as the following: fasting for one or three nights, or for a month or a fortnight, the Krechra penance, the lunar fast, and the Santapana, Mahāsāntapana, Parāka, and Tulāpuruṣa penances. They live in classes of ascetics but because it presents them in a hierarchy with the Paramahamsa at the top. This is precisely the arrangement preferred by Advaita (see Olivelle 1986- 87). Yadava sees Apastamba's comments as refuting the Advaita claim that their highest ascetics are liberated while still alive (jīvanmukta) and are free from many of the rules of Brahmanical etiquette and ethics.

4. The reference is unclear. The commentator, Haradatta, explains that even after attaining knowledge, one must perform the yogic exercises in order to eliminate pain, including the pain a man will suffer in afterlife. The intent clearly is to preclude the possibility of someone living an antinomian life by claiming that he has attained the liberating knowledge.

5. For krechra, see Ch. 4.2 n. 1. Unless the night is specifically indicated by the context, in Sanskrit the term "night" often stands for a full twenty-four-hour day. The "lunar fast" consists of increasing and decreasing by a mouthful the quantity of food eaten each day, according to the waxing and waning of the moon. One eats fif- 5. Principal Activities sacred areas abounding in cows and Brahmins. Thus they liberate themselves.

Paramahamsas are those who carry a triple staff, a water strainer, and a sling. They wear a sacrificial string, as well as an underand an overgarment. They spend a single night in a village and five nights in a town, at a sacred bathing spot, or in a religious house. At the proper time for begging, they make a funnel out of dried leaves and beg almsfood only from Brahmin households, eating just eight mouthfuls. They are faithful to the twilight worship, and they always live at the foot of a tree. Thus they liberate themselves.

Renouncers Who Abandon Vedic Rites 73 12. Speaking of the two types of renouncers, Manu describes the renouncer who abandons vedic rites: I have explained this distinct law of self-controlled ascetics; listen now to the ritual discipline of renouncers who abandon vedic rites. [MDh 6.86] 13. In some regions they read at this place the three verses beginning with "Only after paying his three debts . . .".6 Vedic student, householder, forest hermit, and mendicant: these four distinct orders of life are rooted in the householder.

14. Now, when a Brahmin acts as prescribed and undertakes these in the proper sequence as spelled out in the sacred texts, each and every one of them leads him to the highest state.

15. Yet, following the directives of the Vedas, the householder is proclaimed to be the best of all these, for he supports the other three.

teen mouthfuls on the day of the full moon and decreases the amount of food by one mouthful a day until the new moon, on which day one observes a total fast. The intake of food is similarly increased during the second half of the month. At the Santapana a person subsists on the urine of cows, cow dung, milk, sour milk, ghee, and a decoction of Kusa grass. The penitent may eat all of them on one day and fast on the next day or subsist on each of these six products on six consecutive days and fast on the seventh. The latter is called Mahāsāntapana, "great Santapana." At the Paraka one fasts for twelve days, whereas at the Tulāpuruṣa, according to one description, the penitent subsists on oil-cake, the scum of boiled rice, buttermilk, water, and barley meal, eating each substance in succession on only one day and observing a total fast on the final day. For sources, see Olivelle 1986, 130 nn. 39, 42, and Olivelle 1987, 56 n. 17.

6. The three verse are MDh 6.35-37; see Ch. 2.5. Yadava appears to be referring to a recension of Manu in which these verses are given immediately after MDh 6.86.

7. The Sanskrit term api ("also") appears to have a concessive force here. As several commentators point out, the intention is to assert not that a person must undertake all four orders in succession if he is to attain the highest state but that each of these four (this appears to be the sense of sarve 'pi: "all") can lead to that state.

'74 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 16. As all rivers and rivulets ultimately end up in the ocean, so people in all orders of life ultimately end up with the householder.8 17. All twice-born people who belong to any of these four orders should observe the ten-point Law diligently and unfailingly.

18. Resolve, forbearance, self-control, honesty, cleanliness, mastery of the senses, modesty, learning, truthfulness, and suppressing anger: these are the ten points of the Law.

19. Those Brahmins who learn and then observe the ten points of the Law attain the highest state.

20. If a twice-born man has steadfastly followed the ten-point Law and is free from debt, he may renounce after he has learned the Vedanta in the prescribed manner.

21. After he has renounced all ritual activities, thus avoiding their inherent dangers, let him live at ease under the care of his sons and devote himself to the recitation of the Veda. [MDh 6.87-95] 22. Some propose that a Kuticaka live in the very same manner. By using the term "points" in the statement "ten points of the Law" [Ch. 4.19], the author intends to point out that they are supplementary to the Law pertaining to the orders of life. The meaning, therefore, is that, as they follow their respective Law, people belonging to all the orders should be in the habit of practicing the ten points of the Law beginning with resolve.

Mendicant Renouncers 23. Next, we will describe the Law pertaining to the order of mendicant renouncers. Kratu states: Samkhya, Yoga, devotion to Visṇu, vigilance, detachment: these are what is essential, while duties other than these are said to characterize it as an order of life.

24. This is what the text intends to say. "Samkhya" is the knowledge of the cosmological principles. "Yoga" may be either the one with 8. The meaning of "end up in" appears to be as follows. The existence of rivers depends on their connection with the ocean: it provides them initially with their water and into it they finally merge. Similarly, the existence of people in other orders depends on the householder in a variety of ways: the others obtain food from householders, and new recruits are either householders or their children (see MDh 3.77-78). In a more pregnant sense, however, they end up with the householder, because in the rebirth process they become transformed into the semen of the householder through whom they receive their new birth.

9. Ritual duties as well as normal household activities entail violence and injury to living beings. On the dangers of household life, see MDh 3.68; 5.39-41.

5. Principal Activities 75 eight components or the one with six.10 "Devotion to Visṇu" is the worship of the Lord, namely, love of the Supreme Self. "Vigilance" is to remain constantly alert. "Detachment" is not to be attached to sensual objects. 25. Accordingly, Brhaspati remarks: When a man is attached to the Supreme Self and detached from all else, and when he is freed from all desires, he is fit to eat almsfood. [cf. NPU 139] 26. The meaning of the statement "these are what is essential, while duties other than these . . ." [Ch. 4.23] is as follows: These alone constitute the principal Law of that order of life. Duties other than these, for example twilight worship, merely characterize it as an order of life, while the Law of that order constitutes its true essence. A person who is steadfast in the performance of those duties is merely steadfast in his order; he is not steadfast in the Law of his order. Activities such as twilight worship are thus reduced to the level of accessories to the Law of that order; they themselves are not part of the Law.11 27. This position is supported by Dakṣa: A man who does not perform the twilight worship is always impure and is unfit to perform any rite. Whatever other rite he may perform, he will not reap its reward.

Sāmkhya 28. Of those essential duties, I now describe Samkhya. Yama states: No matter what order of life he may be devoted to, when a man knows the twenty-five cosmological principles--that is, the primary substances and the transformations-he is freed from sorrow.

10. Yadava discusses (Ch. 5.47-89) the former, which is the traditional Yoga system, but not the latter, which the Pañcarātra text Visnusamhita calls "Bhāgavatayoga" (30.1-2). It lists the six components as control of breath, withdrawal of senses, concentration, reasoning (tarka), trance, and meditation (30.57-58).

11. Kratu's text and Yadava's commentary on it are far from clear. The lack of clarity, no doubt, has caused the bewildering variety of readings obtained in the manuscripts. I believe the text of the critical edition is correct. An inability to follow Yadava's thought appear to have caused several of the scribes/editors to emend his commentary. Yadava distinguishes the outward manifestations of a particular order of life from its inner core or essence. The former he refers to as mere "order of life" (āśrama), while he characterizes the latter as "the Law of the order" (āśramadharma). The Law consists of the five points mentioned by Kratu, while other duties, such as twilight worship, constitute what Yadava terms asrama, that is, activities that outwardly mark a particular order of life. I assume that begging and carrying a triple staff-indeed most of the customs discussed in Chapter 6-fall into the latter category. Chapter 5, on the other hand, is devoted to the description of the former five points (especially the first three), which according to Yadava constitute the "principal duties" (mukhyakarma) of an ascetic. See also Ch. 1.23.

176 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 29. Mind, intellect, ego, ether, air, fire, water, and earth are the eight primary substances. The remaining sixteen are the transformations.

30. Ears, eyes, tongue, nose, skin, ideas, sound, form, taste, touch, smell, speech, hands, anus, sexual organs, and feet are, according to the scriptures, the sixteen transformations.

31. "Ideas" refers to the activities of the mental organs.

Sages call this the knowledge of the twenty-four. The twenty-fifth is the unmanifest,12 and the twenty-sixth is the Supreme Lord. When they come to know this, ascetics with calm minds attain liberation.

32. Without sound or taste, beyond touch or smell, formless and pure, transcending pleasure and pain-that is the highest step of Visnu.

33. It is unborn, immaculate, and calm, it is unmanifest and imperishable, it is without beginning or end, it is knowledge, it is Brahman-that is the highest step of Visnu.

34. Bṛhaspati: This here is the highest being, from which manifold beings arise and into which they retum, like pots from clay.

35. This here is the highest light, of which others are like sparks. It is scattered in the sun, moon, fire, lightning, stars, planets, and the like.

36. This here is supreme bliss; others, mere specks of joy. From it they drink who do meritorious deeds-Brahma, Indra, ancestors, and men.

37. In His aspects of unity and multiplicity, the Lord resides in all beings. This is the highest unity--the highest being, the highest goal.

38. After this opening statement, Bṛhaspati goes on to state in closing: When, in this manner, a man comes to know Brahman, he is freed from samsara.

39. Śaunaka: Earth, water, fire, wind, and ether-a learned man should recognize these as the five elements.

40. Ears, eyes, skin, tongue, and nose--one should recognized these as the five organs of cognition within this body.

41. Mind, intellect, and self, as well as the unmanifest--these, they say, are the four that are said to be beyond the sense organs.

42. Sound, form, touch, taste, and smell--a wise man should always recognize these as the objects of the sense organs.

43. Hands, feet, organ of generation, tongue, and anus-he should always recognize these as the five organs of action within this body.

12. This probably refers to the Samkhya category of primal nature (prakṛti). In classical Samkhya there are only twenty-five principles, including spirit, primal nature, and the twenty-three products of primal nature.

5. Principal Activities 44. These twenty-four are said to be the cosmic principles. Transcending them stands the Male Principle that one understands as the self.

45. When they come to know this, ascetics with calm minds attain liberation. This here is the supreme secret, this is the highest imperishable state.

77 46. The rest of this text beginning with "Without sound or taste, beyond touch or smell, formless . . .," is identical to the passage of Yama [see 5.32-33]. One should likewise explore also other texts, such as the Epics, the Puranas, the legal works of Manu and others, as well as the Vedantas, to gain an understanding of the cosmic categories, an understanding that is the expressed by the term "Sāmkhya." Yoga 47. Next, I describe the yogic discipline for a person who has an understanding of the cosmic categories. The yogic discipline with eight components is given in the work of Patanjali [Ys].

The eight components are restraints, constraints, siting posture, control of breathing, withdrawal of senses, concentration, meditation, and trance [Ys 2.29]. The restraints are to abstain from injuring, to tell the truth, to refrain from stealing, chastity, and poverty [Ys 2.30]. The constraints are purification, contentment, austerity, vedic recitation, and contemplation of the Lord [YS 2.32]. The siting posture is a position that is stable and comfortable [YS 2.46]. The control of breathing is the suspension of the breathing process [Ys 2.49]. The withdrawal of senses is when the senses do not come into contact with their respective objects, thereby coming to truly resemble the nature of the intellect [Ys 2.54]. Concentration is to focus the mind on a particular object [Ys 3.1]. The uninterrupted focusing of one's thought on that object is meditation [Ys 3.2]. That very meditation, when it reveals just the object and becomes bereft, as it were, of its own nature, is trance [Ys 3.3].

48. Of these eight components, those beginning with the withdrawal of senses are essential, like the hands and other limbs of Devadatta, while the rest are considered components because of their instrumentality.13 When some of these come into conflict with other more intrinsic components, one should observe the more intrinsic components. 49. Accordingly, the Blessed Vyasa declares: 13. The meaning appears to be that the three components-withdrawal, concentration, and trance-are true components (lit., "bodily parts") of the yogic discipline of the mind, just as hands and feet are essential parts of the body. The first six components, on the other hand, are not essential but serve only to promote the discipline of the mind.

78 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism A wise man should always practice the restraints, even if he has to disregard the others. A man falls if he neglects the restraints and devotes himself solely to the constraints.

50. These same components are described in many different ways in scriptural texts. To begin with, Kratu, after stating "or else with the components of yoga such as restraints" [Ch. 6.23], goes on to say: Resolve, forbearance, self-control, honesty, purity, mastery of the senses, modesty, learning, truthfulness, and suppressing anger-this is the hallmark of the Law.

51. Abstention from injuring, equanimity, and honesty; forbearance, selfcontrol, tranquillity, and the like; contentment, and freedom from malice, deceit, and hostility-the scriptures call these the restraints.

52. Doubt, pride, sloth, attachment, desire for results from actions, fear, possessions, and selfishness-the abandonment (of these), the scriptures say, constitutes the minor restraints.

53. Lust, passion, strife, sleep, delusion, hunger, sinful thoughts, hate, egotism, and greed-victory over these, the scriptures say, constitutes the controls.

54. Humility, virtue, belief,14 yogic discipline, good conduct, learning, rites, impartiality, gentleness, firmness, and detachment-these are the higher restraints.

55. Meditation, tranquillity, amiability, and silence, as well as to refrain from entreating, yearning, touching, or looking-these are said to be the constraints.

56-57. Śaunaka: Ten vows are enjoined on all ascetics: not to injure, to tell the truth, honesty, chastity, poverty, to suppress anger, obedient service of the teacher, cleanliness, to refrain from wrongful conduct in mental, verbal, and physical activities, and to avoid carelessness.

58. Bodhāyana: Now there are these vows: not to injure, to tell the truth, honesty, to refrain from sex, and renunciation.15 There are also five secondary vows: to suppress anger, obedient service of the teacher, to avoid carelessness, cleanliness, and purity in food. [BDh 2.18.2-3] 14. The term "astikya" (lit., "the condition of one who says 'It is"") has a range of meaning, including the belief in an afterlife, in the operation of karma, and in gods.

15. The last item is tyaga. The commentator Govinda and, following him, Būhler take it to mean giving gifts or liberality. I think this is less likely, given the general prohibition against the giving of gifts by ascetics. I prefer to take it as a general reference to the ascetic attitude of renunciation or abandonment with regard to all possessions and relationships.5. Principal Activities 79 59. Yama: Now King Yama, the son of Aditi, has proclaimed the duties prescribed for devout ascetics, as well as for renouncers who abandon vedic rites.

60. Not to injure, to tell the truth, to suppress anger, chastity, austerity, learning, honesty, to avoid transgressions-this, the scriptures say, is the tenfold Law.

61. The Law becomes tenfold because austerity is distinguished into mental, verbal, and physical.16 Contentment, obedient service of the teacher, avoiding carelessness, forbearance, compassion, silence, purity in food, and cleanliness-these are the eight vows.

62. Since there are different types of injury, we must undoubtedly distinguish also different types of non-injury. Now there are ten types of injury: causing anxiety, causing pain, causing someone to weep, drawing blood, calumny, destroying someone's happiness, conquest, making someone grovel, obstructing someone's welfare, and killing. 63. Jābāli the Elder, moreover, gives distinctions that are not well known: The man who does the killing, the man who gives his consent, the man who butchers the carcass, those who buy and sell, the cook, the one who assists in the cooking, and the eater: these are the eight types of killers. 64. Vayu describes truthfulness: Wise men assert that a lie in the service of righteousness causes no harm. In spite of that, one should not tell a lie. Such an inclination is fraught with danger.

65. The same author describes honesty: An ascetic who seeks to be righteous should not tell what is untrue. Even if he is in dire straits, moreover, he should never succumb to stealing. 66-67. Bṛhaspati gives the different types of chastity: To remember, to recount, to engage in amorous play, to look at, to speak in secret, to formulate an intention, to make a firm resolve, and to perform the act-wise men present these as the eight types of sexual relationships. Their opposite is chastity, and it, likewise, is of eight types.

68. Likhita describes poverty: He should not speak in Sanskrit but should behave like a man who is childish and dumb. He should not accumulate possessions, not even the articles of an ascetic, for use at a future date.

16. Yadava here intends to show how the Law is tenfold even though only eight items are listed, because austerity is further divided into three types.

1 80 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 69. I will cite later [Ch. 6.5-8] Garga's description of purification. 70. Yama describes vedic recitation: When he is tired of meditation, an ascetic shall always spend his time in silent prayer, and when he is tired of silent prayer, in meditation. He should thus continue this process, meditating sometimes and praying silently at other times.

71. The four cooked offerings along with the vedic sacrifices-all those taken together are not worth a sixteenth portion of the sacrifice of silent prayer.17 [cf. MDh 2.86] 72. A sacrifice of silent prayer is ten times better than a vedic sacrifice; that prayer is a hundred times better, the scriptures say, when it is said inaudibly, and a thousand times better when it is recited mentally. (cf. MDh 2.85) 73. Manu: He should always recite silently the vedic texts pertaining to the sacrifice and to the gods and those pertaining to the self, as well as what is expressed in the Vedantas. [MDh 6.83) 74. "What is expressed in the Vedantas" is OM.18 Āpastamba: He speaks only during his private vedic recitation. [ApDh 2.21.10] 75. Bodhāyana: Morning and evening let him recite silently the mantras used at the daily fire sacrifice (BDh 2.18.20]. This is the rule when a man who had been in the habit of offering the daily fire sacrifice departs for the ascetic life. 76-77. Kapila describes the contemplation of the Lord: Bathing at dawn, silent prayer, silence, the habit of living always in solitude, paying homage, fasting, devotion to Visnu and to one's teacher, belief (see Ch. 5.54 n. 14), constant recitation of the Veda, 19 being faithful to the control of breath, and worshipping Visṇu at dawn, noon, and dusk-that is the highest means of liberation.

78. Atri: At dawn, noon, and dusk, let him worship Visnu, as well as the gods who share His nature; let him never pay homage to or worship anyone else.

17. The four cooked offerings are four of the five great sacrifices that a Brahmin is expected to offer every day-the offerings to gods, ancestors, spirits, and men. The vidhiyajña, which I have translated as "vedic sacrifices," are the major oblations offered according to the rules set forth in the vedic texts.

18. The original passage of Manu appears to refer to the vedic texts pertaining to the self found in the Vedantas. This is the interpretation of the commentators, which is followed by Būhler. Yadava, however, takes the expression vedāntābhihitam as a separate entry referring to OM.

19. The meaning of brahmasamsparsa is not altogether clear. It may mean close contact or intimacy with brahman, which in this context probably refers to the Veda or perhaps to the syllable OM (see Ch. 5.95).

5. Principal Activities 81 79. Kratu: The Blessed Lord Visnu, who is the Highest Self, the great unborn one, the single ruler of what moves and of what moves not-He is the highest goal of ascetics.

80. The same author states again: After he has resorted to the emblem of Visnu [see Ch. 3.48-51], if a man meditates on or worships another deity, he will have no happy afterlife for a thousand million eons.

81. The same author says further: Let him conduct his worship with the Puruṣa hymn [RV 10.90] and his praise with the hymns to Visnu20 and meditate on the single syllable OM. Let him silently recite the vedic texts pertaining to the sacrifice, as well as the triple and the fourfold prayer, as he controls his breath.

82. The triple prayer consists of OM, the Great Utterances, and the Gayatri verse; the same three together with the Siras formula constitute the fourfold prayer.21 Sankha describes the sitting posture: He should sit with a serene mind in an abandoned house, a temple, a cave, or a mountain cavern, or in a place that he finds pleasant.

83. Assuming a sitting position in the manner prescribed in the yogic texts, he should always engage in yogic meditation, but especially during twilight.22 84. Viśvāmitra: Then, in a sheltered and agreeable place where the ground is flat he should place, one on top of the other, Kuśa grass, an antelope skin, and a clean cloth.

85. Sitting there in the lotus position, he should bring his limbs into equilibrium. Mentally composed, then, he should control his breathing for a while.

86. Śankha describes the characteristics of breath control, withdrawal of the senses, concentration, and meditation: A man burns up his faults through the control of breathing, his sins through concentration, his attachments through the withdrawal of the senses, and his ignoble qualities through meditation.

20. The identity of these hymns is uncertain. They may be the same as the verses going under the name of Viṣṇusūkta; see Ch. 3.6 n. 3.

21. For the great utterances, see Ch. 4.13 n. 13. The Gayatri verse, also known as Savitri (RV 3.62.10), is given at Ch. 4.12. The Siras formula is "OM The waters, the light, the taste, the immortal, Brahman! Earth, Atmosphere, Heaven! OM"-om apo jyoti raso 'mytam brahma bhur bhuvaḥ suvar om (MNU 241-42).

22. This may mean at dawn and dusk, but it could also refer to the three junctures of the days, including noon, which is the juncture between forenoon and afternoon.

82 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 87. When a person recites three times the Gayatri verse together with OM, the Great Utterances, and the Siras formula, as he controls his breathing, it is called the control of breath.

88. The curbing of the sense organs is called the withdrawal of the senses. The curbing of the mind knowledgeable people term concentration.

89. The vision of the God of gods within Brahman through meditative practice is called meditation. I will tell you of a meditative practice even better than that.

90. "Meditation" here refers to trance, while meditative practice refers to meditation proper. The author points this out: In the heart abide all the gods. The breaths are fixed within the heart. In the heart abide the sun and celestial lights. Everything is established within the heart. (cf. BU 84-85] 91. Make your body the lower slab and the syllable OM the upper fire drill. Churn it continuously in meditation. You shall then see Visnu abiding in your heart. [SU 1.14] 92. The meaning here is that one should meditate on Brahman by means of OM, giving up words and other such means. The Vedas likewise state: "OM-thus should a man link himself with the Self" [MNU 540]. 93. Similarly, after stating, "Put away other words" (MuU 2.2.5). the text goes on to say, "OM-thus alone should a man contemplate the Self" [MuU 2.2.6). And also: "One should not ponder over a lot of words" [BaU 4.4.211. 94. Yama states: There are two forms of Brahman that one must know: the Brahman of speech and the Supreme Brahman. After a man has immersed himself in the Brahman of speech, he attains the Supreme Brahman.

95. The Brahman of speech is OM. Yama and Sankha state: The moon abides at the center of the sun, and fire at the center of the moon. The real abides at the center of fire, and Visnu at the center of the real.

96. Viśvāmitra: After controlling his thoughts until his mind has become calm, he should contemplate the orb of the sun shining at the center of his heart. 97-98. And abiding at the center of the sun's orb he should contemplate the moon, fire, and the Brahman of great light. To get rid of all obstacles, he should contemplate god Visnu abiding within the lotus of his heart, envisaging Him as four-armed and brilliant like pure crystal. Then, he should tirelessly contemplate Him as without attributes, preceded by Brahman,23 23. Two types of contemplating God are presented here (cf. Ch. 5.104). In the first, a person imagines Visṇu as having physical attributes, which is almost an icono- 5. Principal Activities 883 99. "Preceded by Brahman": "Brahman" here means the syllable OM; the meaning is that he should contemplate Nārāyaṇa, reciting first the syllable OM.

Over and over again he should contemplate Him as abiding in his heart- He who is the reality, the all, the self of all, the highest state called Viṣṇu, immaculate and salubrious.

100-101. I myself am that Brahman, pervading all and surpassing the self. The kind of mind a person has when he has given up the attachment to sensual objects and confined the mind within the heart-that is his highest state. Let him again take the intellect that he has thus discerned into the Supreme Self.

102. When a sage is unable to attain equanimity, let him suppress his mental activities until they dissolve within his heart.

103. This alone is knowledge and meditation. All else is just a lot of words. When the sense organs are under check and the mind does not stir, then the self shines in all its purity as calm and pure consciousness. 104. Likhita: Imbued with love after examining the Purāṇas and the Vedantas, he should always contemplate in his heart Visnu both with a physical appearance and as without attributes.

105. The contemplation of the self through yogic discipline is the highest of all duties. One should give up everything else that impedes it, with the exception of what is absolutely necessary.24 106. Bṛhaspati: Forbearance is a sacred bathing place, and self-control is a sacred bathing place and so are the control of the sense organs and compassion toward all creatures. Meditation is the most excellent of all sacred bathing places.

107. These five sacred bathing places, as well as truthfulness, which is the sixth, always and everywhere reside in one's body. It is in them that one should bathe.

108. A man who bathes at Puskara, in the Ganges, and in the Kuru forest is not freed from his sins as completely as a man who bathes at the sacred bathing places consisting of forbearance and the like.

109. Wherever a man lives with all his sense organs controlled, that very place is Kuruksetra, it is Naimisa, and it is Puskara.

graphic imagination of Visṇu. In the second, Visnu is identified with the absolute Brahman, who is without parts and attributes. See the concession made to people who are unable to engage in this type of abstract contemplation at Ch. 5.123.

24. The term avasyaka may also mean a call of nature. In that case, the translation would be "... impedes it, unless it is a call of nature." 84 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 110. Pilgrimages to sacred bathing places, as well as the fruits accrued from them, are prescribed for those people who make the distinction, "This is a sacred bathing place, and this is not." 111. For a man who knows that everything is Brahman, there is nothing that is not a sacred bathing place. Whether he is awake, dreaming, or in deep sleep, he always abides in Brahman alone.

112. This is the highest Law. All others-sacrifices, gifts, austerity, and Vedas are mere drops from it, established here under the guise of sacred bathing places.

113. Kratu praises Yoga, as well as the components of yogic practice, such as control of breathing, withdrawal of senses, concentration, meditation, and trance: If a man fills the entire universe with jewels and gives it to people learned in the Vedas, the reward he will receive is perishable, but not that of calling to mind Visnu just once.

114. People who stand in the middle of five fires or in water, people who stand in open air, and people who consume fire and smoke-these are not worth a sixteenth part of a man who performs the control of breath.

115. By subsisting on bark, leaves, flowers, vegetables, water, fruits, roots, and air, a man achieves purity of heart in twelve years, while he does so in one year through the withdrawal of senses.

116. It is easy for a man to engage in yogic concentration when he is devoted to Visṇu in the company of His consort and carrying a discus, sword, and quiver; it is difficult for people who are undisciplined. [ef. MBh 12.289.54) 117. They may be able to endure fire, snow, war, vedic recitation, austerities, and vows, but they are unable to remain even for a moment in the condition that destroys sins.

118. In this world people put up with leprosy, fever, poison, and illness, but they find it difficult to bear those who bring about yogic tranquillity. 119. A pure yogin abiding in trance, who has cut all ties and become like the spotless sky-his is the highest Vaisnava state.

120. People who are stainless like pure crystal, bright like the sun, moon, and fire, cross beyond the reach of darkness when they gladden Visnu with the components of yogic discipline.

121. The fire of yogic discipline burns up all sins of mind, speech, and body committed through ignorance or negligence, as fire burns a bundle of straw. A man of devotion always sees Visnu with the lamp of yogic discipline.

122. Hārīta comments on the conclusion of yogic practice: One is advised to undertake meditation until one obtains the bliss arising from knowing the self. Even after that, however, one should continue to perform the actions prescribed in the Vedas and the scriptures.

5. Principal Activities 85 123. Bṛhaspati presents the type of meditation to be undertaken by those who are unable to meditate on Brahman without attributes: If a person is unable to meditate on the formless Brahman, let him purify himself by controlling his breath and meditating on His embodied form. 124. When a person recites three times the Gayatri verse together with OM, the Great Utterances, and the Siras formula [see Ch. 5.82 n. 211, as he controls his breathing, it is called the control of breath.

125. A man burns up the faults of mind, speech, and body through the control of breathing, his attachments through the withdrawal of the senses, and his ignoble qualities through meditation.

126. As the impurities of metals are removed by blowing (with bellows in a furnace), so the sins committed by the senses are burnt up through the control of breath.

127. Let him practice these three moments of breath control repeatedly: inhalation, retention, and exhalation. By meditation on Brahma, Viṣṇu, and Siva, a man is freed from bondage.

128. Let him contemplate Brahma, the Grandfather, as red in color; Visṇu as having the color of a blue lotus; and Śiva as white and with three eyesthey are the boats to cross the ocean of samsāra.

129. The ascetic who lives in this manner totally devoted to yogic practice achieves complete detachment and attains the highest state.

130. Vasudeva is the highest Brahman, he is the highest self, and he contains the whole universe. They are indeed his embodiments, for they are differentiated by name into three.25 131. Every day let him meditate with devotion on Nārāyaṇa, the creator of the universe, on Hari, the Lord of all creation.

132. Let him contemplate Him carrying the conch and discus, auspicious with four arms, wearing a crown, bearing the Śrīvatsa mark and the Kaustubha jewel on his breast, and adorned with divine gems.

133. Let him contemplate Him dressed in yellow, tall in stature, with a face as pleasing as the moon, dark-skinned, lotus-eyed, and wearing earrings shaped like gleaming crocodiles.

134. Let him contemplate Him as removing afflictions instantly, risen like the cloud at the end of time, shining with all brilliance, holy, and giving protection to those who seek it.

135. Let him meditate fervently on Nārāyaṇa as lotus-eyed and salubrious, duly worshipping Him in his mind with the sixteen services.26 25. The meaning is that all three embodied gods who are the subject of this type of meditation-Brahma, Visnu, and Śiva-are in fact three aspects with different names of the one ultimate god, here referred to as Vasudeva.

26. The services are rendered mentally rather than externally during yogic meditation. The sixteen services are invitation, seat, water to wash the feet, water given to 186 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 136. Dattatreya: People who seek liberation worship with the eighteen offerings the Blessed Purusottama as abiding in the heart, in fire, and in the sun. 137-41. The worship of Visnu with Palasa leaves [see 3.64 n. 30] and lotus blossoms is said to be praiseworthy. After thus tirelessly worshipping Nārāyaṇa, the king of gods, let a yogin contemplate with a collected mind His appearance while reciting OM. Or, according to his special yogic practice, he should always envisage him with a bodily form- He is a male, colored like the sun, lotus-eyed, dressed in spotless gold, conch, discus, and mace in his hands; adorned with a crown, with lovely bangles and bracelets; The husband of Śri, his chest resplendent with jewel and Śrīvatsa mark, Hrsikeśa! Acyuta! dark-skinned and lotus-eyed; standing or seated in the middle of the lotus that is my heart.

142. Let him contemplate in this manner the God who is the supreme Lord of the whole universe, who wipes out all afflictions, and who pervades causes and effects.

143. Śankha explains the reward of practicing yoga: A yogin, versed in all the yogic and Vedantic texts, should always contemplate Brahman in conformity with its qualities as specified in each.27 144. Nevermore dejected, he definitely attains that light. As he becomes one with it,28 he attains the bliss, happiness, and nonduality that is revealed by it in manifold ways and achieves the highest freedom.

145. Yajnavalkya: Sacrifice, good conduct, self-control, abstaining from injuring, gifts, private vedic recitation-of all these activities, the highest duty is to obtain the vision of the self through yogic practice.

146. Viśvāmitra: The supreme Brahman, which is nondual and happiness itself as proclaimed in Samkhya, reveals itself to the yogin who meditates in this manner and who is established in Brahman.

a valued guest, water for sipping, bathing, garment, sacrificial string, perfume, flowers, incense, lighted lamp, food offering, obeisance, circumambulation, and farewell. The list of eighteen services contains in addition ornaments and betel leaves. See Kane, II, 729.

27. The meaning appears to be that the yogin should meditate on Brahman as endowed with the qualities that the yogic texts and the Vedantas ascribe to Brahman.

28. Probably becoming one with Brahman, here identified as the light.

5. Principal Activities 147. When the ultimate reality reveals itself wise men attain liberation. It is not attained by anyone else who is not devoted to yogic practice and to ritual activities.

148. Therefore, one should also perform rites every day at the proper time. These rites are associated with knowledge, and they should be performed by those who desire liberation.

149. Bṛhaspati: As he meditates in this manner, the lamp of knowledge rises and the mental impressions derived from his past lives disappear, like darkness at the rising of the sun.

150. With all that he should purify his impure mind, for only when it is rendered immaculate does a man disappear into Brahman.

151. Medhātithi describes the nature of liberation: A liberated man joins the ultimate as rivers join the ocean. He becomes that, he receives its name, and he is not born here again.

152. For he becomes the self of all beings-beings belonging to the realms of matter, gods, sacrifice, and the self.

153. He is Brahmā; he is Visṇu; he is Śiva; he is Sun and Yama; he is Fire and Nirrti; he is Wind and Īsāna—he is the king of all beings.

154. He is the Vedas; he is the sacrifices; he is the gods; he is cattle, sacrificial gifts, and the like; he is also faith and the like; he is the oblation; he is time; he is the rite and the performer of the rite; he is resolve; and he is the rule. Of all he is the self and the haven-he is the lord of all beings. 155. Kratu describes Samkhya and Yoga, as well as their rewards: Let him cleanse the organs of action with his mind and his intellect with knowledge. Let him purify his mental dispositions with that very purification, and his knowledge and ignorance by means of his teacher's words. 156. In his imagination let him appoint the intellect as his queen, virtue as his minister, the mind as the doorkeeper, and the ego as the general.

157. Those among them who are without desire he should appoint as superintendents over ten villages. The great fort is surrounded by three ramparts and made up of the five elements.29 158. The soul remains like the king seated on the throne of yogic might; he remains like a witness knowing everything and observing the disparity of qualities.

87 29. The verse is elliptical and somewhat obscure. It is not clear to what internal organs the ten superintendents correspond, but they may be the ten organs of sensation and action. The three ramparts are probably the three strands of Samkhyagoodness, energy, and darkness.

188 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 159. Let him give up musing, imagining, anxiety, fear, and perplexity and abandon social relationships and the quest for wealth and righteousness relating to a place, a caste, or personal excellence.

160. Abandoning all thoughts and emotions, let him just think "I am being." Living in solitude, let him always keep that in mind day and night. Thereafter, when his passions have been extinguished, the self immediately enters the highest state.

161. That ends the fifth chapter, entitled "Rules Regarding the Principal Activities," of the Collection of Ascetic Laws.CHAPTER SIX Daily Practices 1. I describe next the daily practices of ascetics. If someone needs to find out about a practice that is not dealt with here, he should gather it from the corresponding practice of vedic students, following the rule that "when they do not run counter to the specific requirements of a particular order of life, these duties of vedic students apply also to people in other orders" [GDh 3.10]. When something is not found even there, one should gather it from the practices of householders. 2. Accordingly, the Blessed Vyasa states: When they are not mutually exclusive, all the practices of every order of life are applicable to every other order of life.

3. Viśvāmitra: Morning Duties Rising in the morning, he should purify himself according to the rules.2 Then, after he has sipped some water, he should diligently use a toothstick to clean his teeth, except on days of the lunar phases.3 1. This is a free and long translation of Gautama's pithy aphorism (lit., "That also for others when not in contradiction."). After listing the duties of a student, Gautama offers this comment to indicate that the duties of a student, which he describes in detail, apply also to other orders of life when those duties do not contradict specific requirements of each order.

2. This is probably an allusion to answering the call of nature in the morning. After going to the toilet one performs the required purification before engaging in other activities.

3. These are the full moon and the new moon, as well as the eighth and fourteenth days of the lunar month. The term "parvan" may also refer to other astronomical phases, such as the equinox and the solstice. Toothsticks are made from small twigs of a variety of medicinal trees (see Kane II, 655). The tip of the twig is crushed to form a brush for cleaning the teeth.

89 '90 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 4. After bathing, he should pray silently until the sun comes into view. The mantra prescribed at sunrise begins "Rise up, O Brahmanaspati!"4 5. Garga: We will now explain the purifications relating to the observances and disciplines of mendicants, as well as the corresponding expiations. To start with, we will describe the purification after passing urine. Filling each time the three joints of his fingers with earth, he should clean the penis four times, the left hand twelve times, and both hands eight times. Having purified his penis in the manner prescribed after urinating," he should perform the purification of the anus. He should apply first one handful of earth, and half that amount the second and the third time. Applying earth in this manner, he should purify his anus twenty times, his left hand twice that many times, and both hands twenty-eight times. He should clean his feet, as well as his hands, by applying earth three times. Finally, he should sip some water, control his breath three times, and sip water again.

6. If, when earth is unavailable, a person uses sand for purification, then he should apply it twice the number of times prescribed above. A mendicant in good health should not be remiss in his purifications. If he is remiss, he commits a sin. To remove such a sin, he should control his breath three times and sip water again.

7. Rising at the time sacred to Brahma, he should contemplate the Highest Self in his heart every day, reciting the mantra that begins "Delighting in wealth, you are powerful" [MNU 539].

8. Then, having first taken some earth, he should answer the call of nature and perform four times the purification prescribed for householders. If he takes the earth after he has answered the call of nature, however, he should bathe by entering the water fully clothed.

9-12. Devala: A single portion of earth, according to the scriptures, is the amount that would fill the three joints of one's fingers. He should clean the penis four times, the left hand twelve times, and both hands eight times. Then he 4. According to the variant recorded in mss A1 2 R1, the mantra is taken from TA 4.2 and extends up to the words anu me'mam satham.

5. The text here is obscure and possibly corrupt. The exact meanings of the Sanskrit terms "niyama" and "samyama" here are unclear, but they probably refer to the disciplinary practices of ascetics. The compound word may also be translated as "... explain the observances, disciplines, purifications, and expiations of mendicants." 6. The meaning appears to be as follows. When a person voids excrement, he should first perform the purification of the penis in the same way as he would after he has urinated and then undertake the purification of the anus.

7. This time of the morning sacred to Brahma is defined in different ways. In general, it is the time between the first light and sunrise. See Ypra trans., 8.34n.

6. Daily Practices should do the purification of his anus by applying earth on it twenty times; the first time he should apply a handful, and half that amount at each subsequent time. He should then clean his left hand forty times, both hands twenty-eight times, and each of his feet three times. If sand is used, then the number of cleansings is doubled. Having sipped water twice, and then three times, he should sip again after controlling his breath.8 13. The same author states: He should always take the earth before he goes out to void urine or excrement. If he takes it afterward, he should bathe by entering water fully clothed.

14-15. Jamadagni: One method of purification is prescribed for the daytime and another for the night, and yet another at times of difficulty. The prescribed method applies to persons in good health and in daytime. Half the prescribed purification is to be performed during the night, half that of the night when one is sick, and half that of the sick when one is on the road.

16. Devala: After voiding urine or excrement, an ascetic should control his breath once, twice, or three times, depending on the place, the time, and the like. 17. The same author states: Meditation, divine worship, eating, brushing the teeth, answering the calls of nature, and bathing: at these six times silence is enjoined. 18. Vayu: Even when he sips water properly, a man becomes impure if he does so with his head covered up to the ears, while he is in water or on a vehicle, while he is standing or talking, or with unwashed feet or untied topknot. 19. Devala: When someone has diarrhea, vomits, or voids urine or excrement during the morning or evening twilight worship, he should bathe in the middle of that worship, conclude the worship of the sun, and control the breath three times.9 20. Scriptures prescribe that control of breathing is done at night with just a single recitation of OM and at midday while reciting it several times. An ascetic should not sip water while he is seated on a wooden bench.10 91 8. Following the description of the rite at Ch. 6.5, it may be possible to emend the edited text by changing the second acamya to ayamya. The verse would then read dvir acamya trir ayamya pranan apy acamet punah: "Having sipped water twice, he should sip again after controlling his breath three times." 9. The reading of this verse is unclear and possibly corrupt. The translation is tentative.

10. The meaning of kāṣṭha is unclear. I have taken it to mean a wooden seat, because there is a general prohibition against sipping water while sitting on a seat (see 92 21. Garga: Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism Vedic students and ascetics should not wash the inside of the penis. If they do so, they should observe a lunar fast.11 22. Then, after brushing his teeth, he should bathe. Kratu states: Ascetics, yogins, students, people who are a hundred years old, those who speak the truth, those who keep vows, good women, and people devoted to giving gifts-they are always purified by bathing.

23. A man should never bathe before he has purified himself after going to the toilet. For the old and the sick, a bath consisting of the recitation of mantras, or with the use of hot water, or else with the components of yoga such as restraints [see Ch. 5.47) is prescribed. An ascetic should always perform the Varuna bath using the mantra "Waters, you bring delight."12 24. Dakṣa: When morning comes, he should purify himself according to the rules, brush his teeth, and then take a bath.

25. With its nine openings, the body is extremely dirty. Day and night it continuously oozes through them. It is the morning bath that purifies it. 26. A bath taken after the first light, at dawn, or even after sunrise is equal to a Prājāpatya penance [see Ch. 4.2 n. 1]; it erases all sins.

27. A Brahmin who gets up at dawn and takes the morning bath will expiate in three years the sins he has committed over seven lifetimes.

28. When he performs rites such as bathing, he should meditate on the god Nārāyaṇa; for, as the Vedas say, it expiates all evil deeds. 13 29. A holy man given to bathing possesses ten qualities: beauty, majesty, strength, purity, longevity, good health, freedom from desires, elimination of bad dreams, austerity, and wisdom.

30. Kapila: A person who is unable to take the morning bath should wash the body below the navel, clean the body and the head with a wet piece of cloth, change the underwear, and perform the twilight worship. He should al- Devannabhatta, Smṛticandrika, āhnikakāṇḍa, p. 102). The normal posture for sipping is sitting on one's haunches with the elbows between the knees.

11. Washing the inside of the penis probably means washing inside the foreskin. For the lunar fast, see Ch. 5.11 n. 5.

12. This formula is found at RV 10.9.1-3 and TS 4.1.5.1. The normal bath with cold water is called the Varuna bath, for which there are several substitutes. The bath by reciting vedic mantras (brāhmasnana or mantrasnana) consists of sprinkling oneself with water while reciting the mantra "Waters, you bring delight." For the various types of baths, see Ypra 37.

13. The meaning could also be that meditating on Nārāyaṇa rectifies any rite that is not properly performed.

6. Daily Practices ways bathe either before or after midday. Then, after he has sipped some water, he should control his breath three times and sip water again.

31. Viśvāmitra: If a person is unable to take the morning bath, he should perform the Kapila bath. 14 One who is unable to do even that should perform the bath consisting of mantras.

32. Angiras: When the time for the bath has come, he should put on half the normal amount of clothes, and half the latter amount-that is, just a loinclothduring the time of silent prayer.

93 33. In this manner, he should bathe at dawn, noon, and dusk. The mantras recited while sprinkling oneself15 are "We appease your anger, O Varuna..."[TS 1.5.11.3]; "Loosen the upper, the middle, and the lower noose, O Varuna..." [TS 1.5.11.3]; and "I have sung the praise of Dadhikrāvan..." [TS 1.5.11.4], together with the three verses beginning "Waters, you bring delight" [RV 10.9.1-3]. The four mantras beginning with "Golden colored. . ." [TS 5.6.1] and the lesson that begins "The purifier..." [TB 1.4.8] are prescribed at this sprinkling.

34. Next, the sipping of water while reciting mantras. In this regard, Kratu states: After sipping water while reciting the fourfold mantra, he should sprinkle himself with purified water as he recites the Aghamarṣana hymn16 and the verse "Freed from the post, as it were..." (TB 2.4.4.9) and offer libations of water to gods and ancestors.

35. The meaning of this is that he should sip water four times reciting each time the fourfold mantra. Manu states: The Gayatri verse accompanied by ten recitations of OM, preceded by the seven Great Utterances, and followed by the Siras mantra'7 is said to be the destroyer of sins.

14. The Kapila bath is described in the previous verse. The inability to bathe normally is due to sickness or old age.

15. Technically called mārjana ("washing"), this is part of the twilight worship and consists of sprinkling oneself with water as one recites the mantras listed.

16. This hymn (RV 10.190) is considered to be specially efficacious in destroying sins. The term "Aghamarṣaṇa" is also used for a particular rite for erasing sins. A person takes water in the right hand cupped like a cow's ear and holds it near the nose. He then breathes onto the water while reciting the above hymn and throws the water to the left.

17. This mantra is found at MNU 342: "OM The waters, the light, the taste, the immortal, Brahman! Earth, Atmosphere, Heaven! OM!" 194 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 36. This lesson hidden in the Vedas is the fourfold mantra. Some maintain that the fourfold mantra consists of the syllable OM, the Great Utterances, the Gayatri verse, and the Siras mantra.18 Devala: Having sprinkled water on his body while reciting the Gayatri verse and the Aghamarṣana hymn, he should offer handfuls of water as libations to Visnu as he recites the twelve names of Visnu.

37. An ascetic, after he has purified himself, should first offer libations of water with one hand-one libation per name-as he recites the twelve names of Viṣṇu, each preceded by OM and followed by the word "Homage!" 38. These mantras read as follows: "OM Homage to Keśava!"19 Next, he offers libations to gods and ancestors.

Taking in his cupped hands water sufficient to fill a bull's horn, he should offer a libation to the gods. In like manner and with his hands properly joined, he should then offer a libation to his ancestors.

39. He should offer the libation to the ancestors wearing the sacred string in the sacrificial position and using the part of the hand sacred to the gods.20 At the conclusion, moreover, he should say "Glory! Homage!" and utter the words "I satiate." 40. "OM Earth, I satiate! OM Atmosphere, I satiate! OM Heaven, I satiate! OM Earth, Atmosphere, Heaven! Glory! Homage! I satiate! OM Earth, svadha OM! OM Atmosphere svadha OM! OM Heaven svadha OM! OM Earth, Atmosphere, Heaven! Glory! Homage! Svadha OM!" This mantra ends with the exclamation "svadha."21 41. After conclud- 18. It is unclear what the lesson hidden in the Vedas refers to and how that is different from the latter view. The fourfold mantra as described here is given at MNU 340-42.

19. The twelve names are Kesava, Nārāyaṇa, Madhava, Govinda, Visṇu, Madhusudana, Trivikrama, Vamana, Śrīdhara, Hrṣikeśa, Padmanabha, and Damodara. Thus, the first mantra would read om keśavaya namah-"OM Homage to Kesava!" The others are formed by inserting the other eleven names.

20. At divine sacrifices the sacred string is worn looped around the left shoulder and resting on the right hip. When offering libations (and when sipping water), different parts of the hands are used. These parts are considered appropriate for various divinities. Although sources are not unanimous, in general the extremity of the palm (i.e., the tips of the fingers) is used to pour water for the gods, while the root of the index finger (i.e., between thumb and index finger) is used in rites for ancestors (cf. Kane II, 652). Likewise, at ancestral rites the sacred string is worn from the right shoulder extending toward the left hip. Ascetics, on the other hand, are not expected to make ancestral offerings. Thus, even in rites intended for the ancestors, ascetics use ritual modes appropriate for the gods.

21. The author here gives the actual mantras used in the offering of libations to the ancestors. The exclamation "svadha" is used at the conclusion of mantras used in offerings for ancestors. Its counterpart, used for gods, is "svāhā." 6. Daily Practices 95 ing the bath and controlling his breath three times, he performs as before rites such as the sipping of water while reciting mantras and the twilight worship. A water strainer is closely associated with the five rites beginning with the sipping of water.22 If, when a water strainer is available, a man performs the rites of sipping, sprinkling water, offering libations, worshipping the sun, filling the water pot, and silently reciting the Gayatri using something else, all those rites will become fruitless for him. 42. Medhātithi: Let him use that [i.e., water strainer] at sipping, sprinkling, offering libations, worshipping the sun, and filling the water pot.

43. Gālava: If an ascetic fails at any time to use a water strainer at sprinkling, sipping, offering libations, and worshipping the sun, all those rites will become fruitless for him. He should, moreover, perform an expiatory penance. 44. Atri: Water that has been drawn out, water that flows, and water in an unsullied lake such water is pure, the Vedas declare, and should not be filtered with a cloth strainer [see Ch. 1.14 n. 9).

45-46. Hārīta: After he has bathed and sipped water according to the rules, he should perform the twilight worship before sunrise and in the prescribed manner, reciting silently the triple prayer.23 He does so either standing or seated and carrying in his two hands a water strainer and the rosary of Rudrākṣa beads, as well as two purificatory rings made of cow's hair, rings that destroy sins.24 47. He should then worship the sun-in the morning reciting the three mantras beginning "The fame of Mitra..." [TS 3.4.11.5] and in the evening reciting the five mantras addressed to Varuna.25 48. An ascetic, being totally devoted to the Highest Self, should make an offering of water to the sun at dawn, noon, and dusk, as well as after he has finished his meal.

22. The five rites are sipping, sprinkling water, offering libations, worshipping the sun, and filling the water pot. The meaning is that he uses the water strainer to purify the water used at these rites.

23. The triple prayer consists of the syllable OM, the three Great Utterances (bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ), and the Gayatri verse; see Ch. 5.82.

24. These rings are generally made of the sacred darbha grass (although here cow's hair is specified) and are worn at certain rites. They are intended to purify the performer. One stands while performing the morning twilight worship and is seated during the everning worship.

25. These mantras follow immediately after the three to Mitra at TS 3.4.11.5-6. See also BDh 2.18.21.

96 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 49. At the worship following the meal he uses the mantra "Gazing up from the darkness..." [TS 4.1.7.4], while at the time of begging he uses the Hamsa mantra.26 At sunrise he should make an offering of water with a collected mind as he recites the Gayatri verse. If the sun sets while he is engaged in silent prayer, he should make the water offering at the end of his silent prayer. 50. Devala: He should worship the sun at dawn, noon, and dusk. Then, after making a circumambulation clockwise, he should pay reverence by bending his knees and bowing his head.

51. He should pay obeisance to the sun without mentioning his name. Then, after offering a libation as before, he should duly engage in silent prayer with a collected mind.

52. Bodhāyana: He should perform the evening twilight worship using the mantras addressed to Varuna and the morning worship using the mantras addressed to Mitra. [BDh 2.18.21] 53. Śaunaka: He should meditate as soon as he gets up from sleep. Then, after he has answered the call of nature, he should purify himself, and sip water. After brushing his teeth, he should bathe before sunrise in the prescribed manner and sprinkle water on himself as he recites the three mantras beginning "Waters, you bring delight" (RV 10.9.1-3] together with the water mantras. Facing the east, then, he should throw upward some water while reciting the Gayatri verse. Holding Darbha grass in his hand, he should remain standing as he recites the Gayatri verse until sunrise. He should spend the rest of the day engaged in silent prayer, meditation, and divine praise. 54. Kapila: Planting his feet firmly on the ground, he should undertake silent prayer, offering nourishment, 28 and worship. Then, standing or seated facing the east and holding purificatory rings in his hands, he should silently recite the triple prayer according to his ability, using either his fingers or a Rudrākṣa rosary. He should control his breath three times at dawn, noon, and dusk. To purify himself of the sins he may have committed by unknowingly killing living creatures, he should use a water strainer at sip- 26. This mantra is RV 4.40.5, which also occurrs at TS 1.8.15.2; see Ch. 6.151. 27. The identity of these mantras is unclear. For the mantras that precede the three mentioned here, see above Ch. 6.33.

28. The term bhojana literally means eating or feeding. In this context, however, it probably refers to the offerings of libations to the sun.

6. Daily Practices 97 ping, sprinkling, offering libations, and filling the water pot. He should perform the worship of the sun with his cupped hands filled with water. 55. After he has thus performed the twilight worship, he should engage in the yogic practice described before [Ch. 5.47. Viśvāmitra says this in the passage that begins After he has bathed, he should engage in silent prayer until the sun comes into view [Ch. 6.4]. Then, in a sheltered and agreeable place where the ground is flat....29 " 56. Having thus performed the yogic practice and likewise completed the ritual procedure given in the text that begins "For a man who performs a sacrifice knowing this... "30 he should then end the yogic exercises and offer a silent prayer. He should then leave that place and, if he observes the vow of spending just one night in a village, go to another village. This is stated by Sankha: After meditating until he has obtained the bliss arising from the knowledge of the self, he should gradually end his yogic exercise. After silently reciting OM and completing his private vedic recitation, he should leave that village and go to another. This is the settled rule.

57. If he does not go to another village, he should remain there engaged in divine praise, silent prayer, meditation, and the like. This is stated by Bṛhaspati: Rising before dawn, he should answer the call of nature and purify himself. Then he should remain reciting the Gayatri verse until sunrise.

58. He should spend the remainder of the day engaged in controlling the breath, silent prayer, meditation, and divine praise, as well as in reciting epic and puranic texts that have vedic sanction.

59. That concludes the description of the morning duties.

Midday Duties 60. Next, I will describe the midday31 duties. In this connection, Śaunaka states: Then, after bathing in the prescribed manner, he should sip water, and sprinkle himself with water as he recites the three mantras that begin "Waters, you bring delight" [RV 10.9.1-3]. Standing in water, then, he 29. The entire passage is given at Ch. 5.84-85.

30. This text of the MNU (543) homologizes various parts of the ascetic's body as well as his daily activities with corresponding objects and operations of a sacrifice. The meaning here appears to be that the ascetic by reciting this text performs a mental sacrifice, transforming his entire existence and activities into a continuous ritual process.

31. For a definition of "midday," see Ch. 6.99.

198 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism should control his breath sixteen times while reciting the Aghamarṣaṇa hymn [see Ch. 6.34 n. 16]. Coming out of the water, he should wash his garment, clean his loins with earth and water, and wear a clean fresh loincloth and outer garment. He should then sip water and take the water strainer while reciting "OM Earth, Atmosphere, Heaven!" Then he offers libations, saying, "OM Earth, I satiate!" 61. The rites described above up to the statement "In like manner and with his hands properly joined, he should then offer a libation to his ancestors" [see Ch. 6.38] are performed as before. Then he worships the sun, reciting the two mantras "His rays raise him up..." and "The bright face of the gods..." [TS 1.4.43.1]. After controlling his breath six times, he should silently recite the Gayatri verse one hundred and eight times. 62. Bodhāyana: He worships the sun with the two mantras: "His rays raise him up..." and "The bright face of the gods..." [TS 1.4.43.1]. "OM is Brahman. Brahman, indeed, is this light. This thing that glows warmly is this Veda. This thing that glows warmly is what we must come to know"- with these very words he satiates the self, and he worships the self. For the self is Brahman, the self is the light. He should then recite the Gayatri verse one hundred times, one thousand times, or an unlimited number of times. Taking the water strainer with the words "OM Earth, Atmosphere, Heaven!" he fetches water. [BDh 2.17.39-42] 63. Hārīta: After bathing and sipping water according to the prescribed rules, he should offer libations with water purified through a water strainer and worship the sun as he recites the appropriate mantras.

64. Kratu: After bathing, a mendicant should silently recite the following in front of the sun: "His rays raise him up...," "The bright face of the gods..." ITS 1.4.43.11, "That bright eye ordained by the gods..." [RV 7.66.16], the Śivasamkalpa verses,32 the Purusa hymn (RV 10.90], and the Visnu hymn.33 65. In the morning he should worship the sun with mantras addressed to Mitra and in the evening with those addressed to Varuna. After the people in the village have finished their meal, he should go on his begging round during the day reciting the Hamsa mantra.

32. These are the group of six verses that begins "That which rises far when people are awake..." (VS 34.1-6).

33. There is no consensus regarding this particular hymn: see Ch. 3.6 n. 3.6. Daily Practices 66. After sprinkling himself with well-purified water as he recites the three Pāvamānī and the three Aghamarṣaṇa verses with explicit meanings,34 he should silently recite the Gayatri verse one hundred and eight times. 67. Visvamitra: Then, after he has taken his midday bath, the wise man should recite the Gayatri silently and with a collected mind and also recite a few vedic texts.

68. To purify himself, moreover, he should silently recite the following: the Visṇu hymn, the Pāvamāna verses, the mantras addressed to Varuna, Rudra, and the sun, and the Upanisad.35 Then, after he has done his meditation as prescribed, he should go on his begging round.

69. Hārīta: Sitting down facing the east, he should silently control his breath three times. After reciting the Gayatri verse as many times as he is able, he should contemplate the highest state. Then, to sustain his life he should always go on his begging round.

70. Devala: Facing the east, an ascetic should silently recite the mantras and hymns of praise.36 There is no time when their recitation is suspended, for scriptures consider that recitation to be an obligatory daily rite.

71. Then he should worship Visṇu in the manner prescribed in the Vedas; if he is unable to use vedic mantras, however, he may optionally use those given in the Pañcarātra texts.

72. Manu: Day and night an ascetic injures living creatures without being aware of it. To cleanse himself of those sins, he should bathe and control his breath six times [MDh 6.69].

99 73. Now, there is a question as to how he should perform divine worship. Since a penance is prescribed when an ascetic plucks fruits or flowers, he should perform the worship with water or with articles 34. This is a tentative translation of the unclear expression "vacyalinga." The Pavamānī are, according to some, the purificatory verses found in the ninth book of the RV, while others take them to refer specifically to RV 9.67.21-27 (Kane II, 317 n. 755). If the word "pavamani" is taken adjectivally, however, the translation would be "the Aghamarsana verses that bestow purity." 35. The Pavamana verses may be the same as the Pavamani (see n. 34). For the mantras addressed to Varuna, see Ch. 6.47 n. 25. Those addressed to Rudra are probably the Rudradhyaya (TS 4.5.1-11). See Ch. 6.267 n. 62, for the mantras addressed to the sun. I am unable to identify the Upanisad referred to here.

36. This appears to be an unusual meaning of "stoka," which usually means "little." The context requires a meaning similar to the one adopted.

100 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism brought by others, reciting the Puruṣa hymn and other mantras contained in the Vedas. 74. Āpastamba: Speaking only during his private vedic recitation, and gathering from a village just enough food to sustain his life, he should go about without regard for this world or the next. The rule is that he should wear discarded clothes; some require him to go completely naked. [ApDh 2.21.10–12] 75. Manu: He should always recite silently the vedic texts pertaining to the sacrifice and to the gods, and those pertaining to the self, as well as what is called Vedānta. [MDh 6.83; see Ch. 5.74 n. 18] 76. Let him reflect on the union, the separation, and the means of separation and contemplate the true nature of the soul, the Lord, and primal matter,37 77. He spends the time until noon engaged in study, meditation, and the recitation of the Epics and Puranas. At midday, too, the same procedure applies.

78. After concluding the rites relating to the bath, he should make the offering of water as prescribed. Then, after worshipping the sun while reciting the two mantras "His rays raise him up..." and "The bright face of the gods..." ITS 1.4.43.11, he should engage in silent prayer.

79. That concludes the description of midday duties.

Begging 80. Next, I describe the procedure of begging. In this regard, Uśanas states: Scriptures have proclaimed five types of almsfood: madhukara ["begging in the manner of a bee" from many houses] not deliberately selected, prakpranita ["offered in advance"], ayacita ["unsolicited"], tātkālika ["contemporaneous"], and upapanna ["offered"].

81. Madhukara, the scriptures say, is food begged in the manner of a bee38 by going to three, five, or seven houses that have not been deliberately selected.

37. In Yoga cosmology, the present condition of humans is created by the union of souls with primal matter (prakyti or pradhana). Separation of the two constitutes liberation, and the yogic techniques are the means of that separation.

38. The comparison with the bee is instructive in at least two ways. A bee gathers nectar from many flowers and does not injure them in the process. Likewise, an ascetic does not become a burden on any single householder by begging a little food from several houses.

6. Daily Practices 82. Prākpranīta, the blessed sage Uśanas has said, is what devout people offer to someone even before he has risen from bed.

83. Ayacita is the almsfood offered by somebody before one sets out on the begging round. Manu has said that it may be eaten.

84. Tātkālika is said to be what is proclaimed by a Brahmin as almsfood as one approaches him. That too may be eaten by a man seeking liberation. 85. Upapanna, sages aspiring to liberation declare, is the cooked food brought by devotees to a monastery.

86. These are the five types of almsfood, and scriptures proclaim that they are equal to drinking Soma juice. A man becomes pure by subsisting on any one of them.

87. Viśvāmitra: Madhukara being the fixed practice, these others are regarded as its substitutes. If an ascetic capable of begging in the mādhukara manner practices any of the others, he commits a sin.

101 88. Prohibitions contained in statements such as "A full meal from a single house, honey, meat . . ." [see Ch. 10.59] are syntactically related to the above statement.39 Therefore, they should be regarded as directed only at those who are capable of begging in the mādhukara manner. Even if one is so capable, it is not wrong for him to eat a full meal from a single house when it is done as an act of kindness. 89. Medhātithi thus declares: He should not eat a full meal from a single house, the food given by a Śūdra, or an excessive amount of food. He may eat a full meal given by a Brahmin either if he is weak or as an act of kindness.

90. Katyāyana: An ascetic may subsist on almsfood that he solicits or receives unasked. 91. Angiras: It is not a sin for ascetics who are sick, old, or suffering from a long illness to eat a full meal from a single house.

92. Bodhāyana: He should eat only as much as is needed to sustain his life. [BDh 2.18.12] 39. A central principle of Brahmanical hermeneutics is that conflicts between injunctions should be avoided as far as possible (see Ch. 2.25 n. 9). Many strategies were devised for this purpose. One of them is called ekavakyatanyāya, the maxim that rules of apparently different provenance form a syntactic or meaningful whole (ie., a single complete sentence) and that their meanings should be derived within this larger context. In the present case, the prohibitions given at Ch. 10.59 are considered as referring to ascetics capable of practicing the madhukara type of begging and not to the old and the sick.

102 93. Kapila: Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism He should eat commendable types of food, such as food received randomly or given spontaneously as soon as he approaches. An ascetic should avoid food that has been offered to deceased ancestors.

94. Yama: An ascetic may beg food in the manner of a bee even from the house of a barbarian. But he shall not eat a full meal even from a man equal to Bṛhaspati.

95. There is no man higher than a Brahmin; there is no god higher than Vasudeva; there is no law that excels the law of classes and orders; there is no scripture that equals the Vedas; there is no purity equal to that of almsfood; and there is no austerity superior to fasting.

96. Almsfood begged in the manner of a bee destroys even the most heinous sins. On such almsfood, therefore, should an ascetic subsist, receiving it in a clean and undamaged bowl.

97. Next, I will describe the rules of begging in the manner of a bee. Manu specifies the time: An ascetic should go on his begging round only when the smoke has stopped rising, the pestles have stopped pounding, the meal has come to an end, and the dishes have been put away. [MDh 6.56] 98. Kratu: A yogin should go around in the forenoon, while a person who possesses the true knowledge should go around in the afternoon (see Ch. 3.30 n. 12]. A mendicant surely commits a sin if he goes around begging at midday. 99. Midday consists of the one and a half hours after the sixth hour following sunrise, according to the definition "The time after midmorning and before noon."40 100. Kapila: A man who is extremely hungry need not wait until the very last moment to beg.

101. Bodhayana addresses the issue of the restrictions as to the place of begging: 40. Within the fivefold division of the day into morning (pratah), midmorning (sangava), midday (madhyahna), afternoon (aparahna), and evening (sayahna), each division is given three muhurtas or six ghatikās (approximately 2 hours and 24 minutes). According to this reckoning, midday extends from 4 hours and 48 minutes until 7 hours and 12 minutes after sunrise. The time given by Yadava is somewhat different.

6. Daily Practices Next, the rules for begging. He should seek to obtain almsfood from Brahmins who follow the mode of life of Sālīnas or Yāyāvaras, after they have completed their Vaiśvadeva offering.41 [BDh 2.18.4] 102. Viṣṇu: He should beg food from the houses of Yayavara householders. The advice of this book is that he should regard this first mode of begging as the best.

103. Going beyond those, an ascetic may beg from householders who maintain the sacred fires, who have faith, who are subdued, who are leamed in the Vedas, and who are magnanimous.

104. Going beyond even those, an ascetic may beg from people who are not Śūdras, who are not wicked, and who have not fallen from their caste. These are the three modes of begging prescribed for him.

105. Medhātithi: He may beg his food from Brahmins, Kṣatriyas, and Vaiśyas. Even among them, he should beg from people of each subsequent class only when those of the preceding class are unavailable.

106. When no one belonging to any of these classes is available, and he has gone three meal times42 without eating, an ascetic may accept almsfood even from a Śūdra, for it is said that an ascetic must preserve his life by means of almsfood.

107. Life is what permits people to pursue the goals of duty, wealth, pleasure, and liberation. Does not a man who destroys life destroy also those goals? And a man who safeguards life, does he not safeguard also those goals? 108. If in an emergency an ascetic begs food from a Śūdra, or a Vaisya, or a Kṣatriya, he should purify himself by controlling his breath a hundred times, fifty times, or twenty-five times, respectively. If he begs from such people without knowing it, the penance for regaining purity is half the listed amounts.

109. Kratu: When an ascetic begs in the manner of a bee, he should not make inquires regarding the donor's ritual practices, religious activities, behavior, virtue, conduct, learning, and lineage, as well as whether the donor is pure 103 41. Sālīna (lit., "people with large houses") and Yayāvara (lit., "itinerant") were two ancient classes of holy householders (see BDh 3.1). The Vaiśvadeva (lit., "all gods") offering is an oblation of food obligatory before any meal.

42. Morning and evening are considered meal times for people. So, not eating for three meal times means that a person has not eaten for a whole day and the morning of the next. Since ascetics are expected to eat only once a day in the evening, this provision boils down to not eating for a whole day.

104 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism or impure, auspicious or inauspicious. Purity and impurity melt away as the almsfood falls into the bowl.

110. Jābāli the Elder: He should not inquire after the donor's class or ask whether the donor is auspicious or inauspicious. When the almsfood falls into the bowl, let him not think whether it is pure or impure.

Another reading of this text is "... into the bowl, purity and impurity melt away." 111. Atri: He should not beg from families that are related to him. Even if he is offered almsfood in the houses of his pupils, enemies, relatives, and kings, or in houses where a death or a birth has recently taken place, he should not accept it. He should avoid any food that he has prepared himself or if accepting it would cause hardship to someone.

112. Kapila: If someone is extremely old, weak, sick, feeble, or physically impaired, he may beg his almsfood from his pupils, relatives, sons, brothers, or friends.

113-14. When an ascetic seeks to obtain external goods such as horses, beds, and seats; when he officiates at sacrifices, teaches, and explains texts and receives in return clothes and vessels; and when he looks at and thinks about women and has sex with them, he becomes guilty of commingling the duties of different orders.43 Whether he lives in a house or in the wilderness, therefore, an ascetic should seek to obtain his almsfood from his son.

115. The same author states: If someone is extremely old, very weak, sick, a hundred years old, or physically impaired, he may beg his almsfood from his pupils, relatives, sons, brothers, or friends.

116. People who are humpbacked, dwarfs, maimed, crippled, lame, blind, or sick are not tainted by any fault relating to their almsfood, as also when a king no longer rules the country.

117. Vasistha specifies the number of houses: Clothed in a single garment or an antelope skin, he should go to seven houses that he has not selected beforehand when the smoke has stopped rising and the pestles have stopped pounding. [VaDh 10.7-9] 43. This is a very tentative translation of a grammatically obscure verse. I have taken "samkari" to mean the confusion of the different orders of life, which parallels the more common fault of causing the mixture of castes.

6. Daily Practices 105 118. Devala: When the aforementioned people are unavailable [see Ch. 6.106], he may go to any house in the entire village, after purifying himself and observing silence. He should, nevertheless, avoid people of ill repute.

119. After careful scrutiny, the gods once determined that the food of a learned Brahmin who is a miser and that of a usurer who is liberal are of the same quality.

120. But Prajapati told them: "Do not create an equality between unequal things. The food of the liberal man is purified by faith, while that of the other is corrupted by lack of faith." 121. A prudent man should not accept forbidden food even when it is offered to him, as well as food that makes one sick or that has been thrown away by someone.

122. Atri: Now I shall describe the rules of begging in their entirety, as well as the types of food one should avoid. An ascetic who neglects them falls quickly, while one who observes them finds release.

123. He should live by the beelike method of begging and never practice the other methods. All these are contemptible means of livelihood, except when he is advised that they are appropriate for him.

124. Food begged in the manner of a bee from houses that have not been preselected or what is given spontaneously-let him eat that irreproachable food with a mind free from greed.

125. A mendicant may always visit three, six, seven, or eight houses-this is the method of begging in the manner of a bee, clearly the most excellent. If he wants he may visit even a larger number of houses.

126. Let him collect almsfood containing every good taste, including such items as rice, barley, oil-cakes, vegetables, buttermilk, milk, and curd, but not anything that would involve an injury to a living being.

127. Whatever food that does not violate a man's vow may be properly eaten by him. He should always eat healthy food that digests easily, but in moderation. An ascetic should avoid foods that would inflame the hu- mors.

128. He should avoid houses with large families or with greedy people, because such people give food with great pain.

129. Whenever there are signs of fraud or misery in a house, a mendicant should avoid it as he would an oblation pecked by a crow.

130. An ascetic should avoid any food presented by a menstruating woman and the food of a twice-born person when presented to him by a Sudra, as well as any food placed in a vessel made of iron or in a part of an animal.44 44. This probably refers to a bowl or a plate fashioned out of bone, horn, or skull (see Ch. 6.247).

106 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 131. An ascetic should refrain from accepting as alms food that had been prepared either as an offering to the ancestors or the gods or for some other purpose, as well as when it would cause hardship to someone.

132. A mendicant should not eat from the house of a couple who have failed to produce any children. If he eats, he should observe a lunar fast [see Ch. 5.11 n. 5).

133-34. When (the food) has been looked at by,45 abortionists, heretics, people afflicted with leprosy and the like, menstruating women, dogs, eunuchs, crows, outcastes, or people of the lowest castes, as also when he sees them somewhere, he should not beg there. If he begs, he should observe a lunar fast. He should not even talk with them, except to ask for directions or when there is a danger.

135. In all social interactions, but especially in begging food, he should avoid all those guilty of heinous crimes or fallen from their castes.

136. When an individual commits an offense, an ascetic should abandon the entire region in the Krta age, the village in the Treta age, the family in the Dvapara age, but just that individual in the Kali age. After abandoning him, the ascetic may go on his begging round.

137. The man who does the act, the man who gives his consent, the man who instigates the act, and the man who approves of the act-all these reap the reward of the action, be it merit or sin. (cf. ApDh 2.29.1] 138. Whether it belongs to a person of one's own lineage or to someone else, a house in which a birth has taken place does not regain its purity until ten days have passed.

139. Rites for gods, ancestors, and the like are never performed in such a house. Neither should a mendicant beg almsfood there. If he begs, he should observe a lunar fast.

140. A mendicant should never seek to obtain almsfood from the family of a relative, from a royal household, or from pupils, relations, friends, and the like.

141. Gods and ancestors do not eat the food given by a husband of an outcaste woman or by a man ruled by his wife: A mendicant should likewise abstain from such food.

142. The special law pertaining to each class and order of life is given the name "hero." Those who abide by it are declared to be heroes, whereas a man who violates it is a murderer of a hero, whom an ascetic should shun. 143-46. A mendicant should not beg almsfood from a naked woman; a virgin; a woman who is pregnant, menstruating, mad, intoxicated, or angry; a woman who is getting ready to eat or who hates her children or husband; a woman who is independent or lives as she pleases; a woman who is 45. The syntax of this sentence (especially of "drstam") is unclear. The translation assumes that it is an ellipsis.

6. Daily Practices without a husband, suffering from leprosy, or blind; a woman who has married a second time or who has been adopted; a woman with loose hair or seated at ease; a lustful woman; a woman astonished; a woman who is deceitful or distressed; a woman of evil conduct; a woman who is sweating or afflicted with a sickness; a shameless woman; a harlot; a tired woman; a servant; a transvestite; a very cruel woman; and a woman who is breast-feeding her baby.

147. Kapila: He should not enter a house with a large family or when the doors are shut. He should not beg almsfood from a woman who is asleep, mad, wanton, intoxicated, sweating, seated at ease, pregnant, sick, in sexual intimacy with her husband, lustful, getting ready to eat, or breast-feeding her baby. He should neither beg nor accept the almsfood offered by a menstruating woman, given contemptuously, handed to him by a naked woman, or brought by a virgin.

148. Kratu: He should avoid salt given separately,46 meat, honey, the food given at a house defiled by the impurity caused by a death or a birth, and the food given by fools, sinners, transvestites, and people fallen from their caste. 149. He should never beg from a woman who is foolish, independent, or a leper, from a woman who hates her children or husband, from a virgin or a midwife, from a woman who has married a second time, or from a naked woman.

150. Jābāli the Elder: One may eat the food of people belonging to only two orders of life, the householder's and the hermit's. The food of people belonging to other orders is not to be eaten, as also the food of other ascetics.

107 151. Next, I will describe the procedure of begging. With regard to this, Saunaka writes: Then, after cleaning his begging bowl with water and a cord of cow's hair while reciting the seven Great Utterances, and after worshipping the sun with the mantra "The swan seated in purity . . ." [TS 1.8.15.2], he should travel silently and with a serene mind.

152. Śankha and Likhita: A begging bowl may be made of any of the following: wood, gourd, cane, and clay. He should scrub it with his hand using water and a cord of cow's hair and then go out to beg almsfood from Brahmins of good conduct.

46. Salt used in cooking is not forbidden to an ascetic, but ascetics are not allowed to have a separate portion of salt on their plates, a practice common at an Indian meal. Such salt is given the technical term "pratyakṣalavana," "visible salt." 108 153. Atri: Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism Taking the bowl in his left hand and the triple staff in his right, he should worship the sun, meditating on the unity of the self.

154-55. Meditating on God with a collected mind, he should silently recite the mantra of purity.47 The person in the sun called by the name Visṇu, who abides within the heart-I am He, the god Nārāyaṇa, the person who is the witness of the world. Let him by himself thus meditate on the self, the person who is the creator of all.

156-57. Then, after performing a circumambulation clockwise, he should worship the sun, the destroyer of darkness. After worshipping it, he should again put on his sandals when he walks on the ground for the sake of purity. He should never discard his sandals, for the water pot and the almsfood become defiled when he walks without sandals.

158-63. Putting on his sandals, a mendicant should walk, meditating on Visnu: May Visnu guard me from the sides, from above and from below; and Vaikuntha from every direction! May Rāma, bow in hand, guard me from all sides; and Keśava, discus in hand! May Govinda protect me, he who drinks soma and eats what's offered to manes and gods; Visṇu, seated on Garuda, Ananta, discus in hand, bearing the aspect of a dwarf; Supreme Self, subtle, pervading all, eternal; without parts or attributes, imperishable, bearing a form all white; without beginning or end; Ever sleeping on Ananta decked with jeweled hoods, at the center of the ocean of milk; May that Madhava protect me! May he protect my entire body, within and without, from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet! May the Garuda-bannered god guard me, bearing every weapon, possessing every power! The self of all, the supreme lord, from the lotus of whose navel was born Brahma, the lord and creator of all; May that Madhava protect me! 47. This long mantra is contained in MNU 440-56. In some sources this mantra plays a major role in the rite of renunciation; see Ypra 14.6. Daily Practices 164. Meditating in this manner, he should go around wearing a single garment and a sacrificial string. For the garment was created by Brahmā for the success of all duties. No rite bears fruit, it is said, when it is performed without wearing a garment.

165. Devala: He should first make his body the dwelling place of the true essence of Brahman and worship with the mantras beginning "Homage to Brahman!"48 He should then silently recite the mantra of purity, perform a circumambulation clockwise as he recites "Coming with true light..." [TS 3.4.11.2], and silently recite the mantra "Your ancient paths..." [TS 7.5.24.1]. Then, he should go around silently.

166. Yama: After purifying himself, he should always go around silently in the evening to beg for pure almsfood. He should wear a single garment or go naked and walk slowly, keeping his gaze within six feet in front of him. 167. He should beg alone and without greed, his gaze fixed on one point. Living without a fire or a home, he should not seek to indulge himself. 168-71. Medhātithi: He should wear one garment from his navel to the knees and a second as an undergarment. Then, after worshipping the sun, he should go to houses to beg for almsfood carrying a begging bowl and a triple staff. After requesting almsfood, he should stand at the door with his head lowered so that he can be seen. Silently and with a totally serene mind, he should stand there in meditation, as if asleep even though it is day. When he sees that no one is responding, he should remain silently for about as long as it takes to milk a cow. If no one offers him anything even after they have seen him, he should proceed to another house. If someone responds, he should wait until the almsfood is given.

172. Kratu: He should walk silently and with a serene mind, detached and self-controlled, as if he were asleep, placing his feet on the ground after determining its purity by inspection, wearing a single garment, and carrying a single bowl.

173. An ascetic should live by eating at the fourth, sixth, or the eighth mealtime [see Ch. 6.106 n. 42], or by observing the lunar fast [see Ch. 5.11 n. 5], or by begging food from five or seven houses of people who are strict in their ritual practices.

174. Standing with his head lowered, he should ask for almsfood just once, placing the word "Lady" at the beginning of the request.49 He 48. The identity of these mantras is unclear. See TU 1.1; Ypra 21.43.

109 49. The wording of the request is bhavati bhikṣām dehi-"Lady, give almsfood." At Ch. 6.185 the ascetic is instructed to place the syllable OM at the very beginning of 110 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism should wait for about as long as it takes to milk a cow. After he has left a house, he should not return to it.

175. Bodhayana: He should make the request, placing the word "Lady" at the beginning. Let him wait for about as long as it takes to milk a cow. [BDh 2.18.5-6] 176. Devala: Ascetics are always required to carry an umbrella on their begging rounds when it is raining, but not to shelter themselves from the sun's heat. 177. Atri: An ascetic should always go alone, wearing a single garment and carrying a single bowl. He should go out to beg just once a day, and never beg again later on.

178. As he walks, an ascetic should not look up, around, or afar. A mendicant should walk casting his eyes on the ground just six feet in of him. 179. He should not peek inside a house through the opening of the door with the desire of getting almsfood. Neither should an ascetic make a loud noise there or knock on the door.

180. After first skipping a house, he should not return there again. If he returns and receives almsfood from there, he should control his breath thirty times.

181. As he begs, he should never visit houses both to the left and to the right. If he skips a house that is without blame, he should control his breath a hundred times.

182. He should enter a house that he has not selected beforehand and whose door is left open by the owner, taking into account the differences in time and place, as well as the ability of the donor.

183-85. He may enter a house to beg if another mendicant has not been there before. After he enters a house, the mendicant should stand with an unflinching mind either in the fire stall or where the housewife can see him. Taking the bowl in his left hand and the triple staff in his right, he should make the request, prefacing it with OM and placing the word "Lady" at the beginning. After making the request for almsfood, an ablebodied ascetic should not sit down anywhere.

186-87. He should not beg for any other thing, greedy for gratification. Purifying with his gaze the almsfood carried in the donor's hand, the ascetic should place his triple staff against his right shoulder with his hand and take the lid off the begging bowl with his right hand. The bowl should always be placed in the left hand and never in the right.

the request. Placing the word "Lady" at the beginning is prescribed for Brahmin students, while Ksatriyas and Vaisyas place it in the middle and end of the request, respectively; see MDh 2.49. The assumption is that the donor is always the housewife. The present injunction assumes, moreover, that the ascetic is a Brahmin.

6. Daily Practices 111 188. Likhita: Even if he is about to die, he should never eat a full meal given by one person. Let him live by begging in the manner of a bee even from an outcaste, for it purifies the mind.

189. If he has been refused once, he should never again enter that house at the time for begging. Even from a different house, moreover, he should never accept as alms any food that has already been prepared for another purpose [see Ch. 6.131].

190. Kāśyapa: Entering just three inches inside, he should stand motionless and evenly on both feet. Unless it contains sticks, stones, or bits of pottery, he should not consider any almsfood as impure and despise it. Rather, he should regard it as pure and accept it. He should never look at the face of the donor, but only at the hands. He should cast his glance not more than six feet in front of him and not look constantly sideways or behind. He should enter houses with open doors and never those where the doors are shut. He should neither knock at a door nor make a loud noise. He should not leave too quickly or stay too long.

191. Devala: If at any time an impediment arises after he has entered a village to beg and as a result he leaves that village, he should not go out to beg again. 192. Jamadagni: If an ascetic does not receive almsfood from a particular house for five or seven days, he should always avoid that house as if it were a house of an outcaste.

193. Every day that a mendicant leaves a house hungry and without food, he takes with him all the merit that that householder has acquired through daily vedic recitation, sacrifice, and giving gifts.

194. The same author states: An ascetic should not take as alms anything besides food, and he should not even take cooked food improperly. One who does so deserves to be punished like a thief.

195. Jabali the Elder: One should eat using a single bowl-this is declared to be the highest vow. If a person is infirm or sick, there is no harm in using two bowls.

196. If an able-bodied and healthy ascetic subsists by using more than a single bowl, that wicked man, greedy for bowls, will end up in hell.

197. When a greedy mendicant asks a donor to fill his bowl, the donor attains heaven, while the eater eats sin.

112 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 198. If a renouncer exhibits any greed when he begs almsfood after receiving an invitation, he will undoubtedly fall.

199. When a man says "Give me more! Give me more!" or asks for salt or condiments, that almsfood becomes equal to cow's meat. After eating such food, one should observe a lunar fast [see Ch. 5.11 n. 5].

200. If a man foolishly refuses to accept what a housewife carries in her hands to give him, he will be born in the wombs of crows.

201. Kapila: After requesting almsfood, he should not tarry long. When someone says "No," he should leave without ill will. He should not ask anyone to fill his one bowl.

202. Bharadvāja: After reciting silently the mantra "O ladle, fly away filled..." (TS 1.8.4.1], he should leave, saying, "Homage!" Procedure of Eating 203. Next, I describe the procedure of eating. Saunaka explains it: Then, after returning from begging, he should place the bowl in a clean place, wash his feet, sip some water, and control his breath three times. Afterward, he should sip water again, sprinkle water on the almsfood while reciting OM, consecrate it with the Gayatri verse, and offer an oblation to Visnu with the mantra "Visnu traversed this..." [TS 1.2.13.1-2). He should then make offerings to the sun with the two mantras "His rays raise him up..." and "The bright face of the gods..." ITS 1.4.43.1), to Brahma with the mantra "Brahman was first born in the east..." [TS 4.2.8.2], and to living beings with the mantra "Homage to beings!" [MNU 463). He should then eat what remains as if it were medicine.

204. Bodhāyana: Then, after returning from begging, he should place the bowl in a clean place, wash his hands and feet, sip some water, and make an offering in front of the sun with the mantras "His rays raise him up..." and "The bright face of the gods..." [TS 1.4.43.1). He should likewise make offerings to Brahma with the mantra "Brahman was first born in the east..." [TS 4.2.8.21, to Visṇu with the mantra "Visṇu traversed this..." [TS 1.2.13.1-2). and to living beings with the mantra "Homage to beings!" [MNU 463]. It is recognized that after an ascetic's final sacrifice the sacred fires reside in the sacrificer himself. His in-breath is the householder's fire (see Ch. 4.11 n. 81, his down-breath is the south fire, his diffused breath is the east fire, his middle breath is the hall fire, and his up-breath is the domestic fire. These five fires indeed abide in the self; hence, he offers only in his self. It is recognized that this is the sacrifice which is offered in the self, which abides 6. Daily Practices in the self, which is founded on the self; and that it leads the self to bliss. After making offerings to living beings with compassion, he should sprinkle the remainder of the food with water and eat it as if it were medicine. [BDh 2.18.7-10] 205. Yama: He should neither eat out of the begging bowl nor use the bowl to sip water. In the Kṛta, Tretā, and Dvāpara ages an ascetic may eat directly out of his begging bowl, but in the Kali age he should not eat out of the bowl or carry a pot [see Ch. 3.70 n. 31].

206. Bharadvāja: He should make a plate out of an old leaf that has fallen down and eat in it but never eat in a metal dish. If he eats out of a metal bowl, he should perform a Prajapatya penance [see Ch. 4.2 n. 1]. He should eat the food after going to a deserted spot outside the village, or to the wilderness, or to a deserted bank or sandy shore of a river, or to a lotus pond. Washing it at a sacred bathing place, he should place the bowl in a sheltered spot. After washing his feet with three applications of earth and likewise also the hands, he should sip some water and control his breath six times. After reciting the hymn to food50 together with OM and the Gayatri verse, and thinking of the food as having the nature of the Highest Self, he should drink some water, saying, "You are an underlayer for ambrosia," and make an offering of food in his breath. If, while he is eating, he finds some food contaminated with tiny bits of hair or insects, he should throw away just that portion, wash his hands, and continue eating. If a hair gets into his mouth, he should discard that mouthful immediately from his mouth, rinse his mouth twelve times with water, and continue eating.

207. Bṛhaspati: After completing his daily duties and with his speech, mind, eyes, and sex organs under complete control, he should gather almsfood in a subdued manner and eat it in a secluded place.

208. While he is eating, he should never touch the food with his left hand or with his feet, nor should he touch his feet, head, or private parts.

209. Outside mealtime, an ascetic should not take anything into his mouth except medicine and the toothstick.

210. Viṣṇu: He may eat as almsfood barley meal, milk, ghee, well-ripened fruits and roots, vegetables, oil-cakes, or grist.

113 50. The identity of this hymn is uncertain. The Ypra (58.46-47) gives the following mantra: "Food is Brahma, the taste is Visṇu, and the eater is Śiva. A twice-born man who eats as he meditates in this manner is not tainted by the defilements of food." A longer hymn in praise of food is given in Vidyarnava 1979, 165, the first sec- tion of which is TA 8.2.

114 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 211. These are the different types of food that bring success to a yogin. One should eat them daily with a totally focused mind.

212. When he is about to eat, the ascetic should first take one drink of water silently and with a collected mind and then eat the first oblation, saying, "For the in-breath, svāhā!" 213. He should eat the second, saying, "For the down-breath, svāhā!"; the next, saying, "For the diffused breath, svaha!"; the fourth, saying, "For the up-breath, svāhā!"; and the fifth, saying, "For the middle breath, svāhā!" 214. After offering in this manner the oblations in the breaths, he should eat the remainder in silence. He should then drink water again once, sip some water, and touch his heart.

215-16. Yama: A mendicant should go out to beg when the smoke has stopped rising and the pestles have stopped pounding and when the sacrifice has been completed. He should not go to a place filled with people who live like dogs51 or packed with hermits, or when the people have not yet taken their meal. He should take only what would sustain his life, and not eat as much as he can get. Let him never eat for the pleasure of it.

217. When one eats almsfood that is pure in its origin and has been sprinkled with water, and from which oblations have been offered, each mouthful becomes equal to a sacrifice.

218. It is sprinkled with water while reciting OM, and it is offered in the internal fires of one's self consisting of the five breaths, while saying "svaha" at each offering.

219-20. The in-breath is the eye, the day, and the sun. The diffused breath is the ear, the night, and the moon. The down-breath is speech, mind, and fire. The middle breath is water, mind, and lightning. And the up-breath is wind and space. Offering food to these breaths with a collected mind, he becomes sated; becoming sated by eating, he is freed from his triple debt [see Ch. 1.14].

221. It is stated everywhere that one should eat the almsfood after sprinkling it with water. Samvarta states: Gathering five, seven, or eight morsels of almsfood, a sage should sprinkle it with water and eat all of it with a collected mind.

51. This may refer to either of two groups of people. The first group consists of people of a very low caste, who are depicted as śvapaka, or cooking dog's meat. The second is a class of ascetics who are said to imitate the habits of dogs or observe the "dog vow" (kukkuravrata). See Digha Nikaya, III, 6-7.

6. Daily Practices 115 222. Kapila: Returning then from the village with a single bowl, he should sprinkle the almsfood with water and eat it immediately. He should not speak at all with anyone. He should not beg for anything else other than medicine. Living in this manner all his life, a mendicant will become liberated. 223. One should consider the following if there is a suspicion of some flaw. Kratu states: He should sprinkle the almsfood with water with the fourfold mantra [see Ch. 5.82], make offerings to Visṇu, Brahma, the sun, and living beings with mantras containing their respective marks [see Ch. 6.204], and give some food to the needy.

224. He should make the lotus of his heart turn its face upward by controlling the in-breath and the other breaths through the suppression of inhalation and the like and offer the food in the fire of Brahman, which is the size of a span he is thus freed from all defilements.52 225. He should neither taste the food nor talk about the six tastes while he eats. Remaining the same whether the food is cooked well and badly, he should not take delight in the one or despise the other.

226. The same author states: He should not throw food away or eat too much; he should neither speak ill of any food or collect too much of it. Let him not treat with contempt cows, Brahmins, the sun, the moon, fire, wind, and water.

227. Kapila: If it does not go against his vow, he may accept even any stale food. If he entertains the desire to put on fat, he should control his breath three times and sip water again. He should place the bowl on a support or on a spot he has cleaned two or three times; sprinkle that bowl with water reciting OM; and consecrate the almsfood with the triple prayer [see Ch. 5.82]. He should at least worship a mouthful of food with the mantra "Viṣṇu traversed this ..." [TS 1.2.13.1-2). He should not eat without making a food offering. Making food offerings to living beings and similar practices, as well as sharing one's food with the needy, are praiseworthy.

228. Sages subsisting on almsfood live happily like bees without causing harm to any living being.

229. "May the moon alone eat the food": the person who eats food reflecting in this manner eats immortality. He eats food in his in-breath, saying, "For the in-breath, svāhā!" He eats food in his down-breath, saying, "For the down-breath, svāhā!" He eats food in his diffused breath, saying, "For 52. This is a rather tentative translation of an elliptical passage with Tantric overtones. The breath is controlled by making the moments of inhalation, retention, and exhalation even and progressively longer.

116 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism the diffused breath, svāhā!" He eats food in his up-breath, saying, "For the up-breath, svāhā!" He eats food in his middle breath, saying, "For the middle breath, svāhā!" Whoever eats food is fire. Whatever food one eats, all that is the moon. He should wash the bowl and take it after consecrating it with the triple prayer. After eating thus he is freed from sin. 230. Viśvāmitra: An ascetic who practices begging in the manner of a bee should offer food to the first four; he should not, however, make offerings to the remaining four.53 231. He should offer to the sun reciting the two mantras "His rays raise him up..." and "The bright face of the gods..." [TS 1.4.43.11; to Brahmā while saying, "Brahman was first born in the east..." [TS 4.2.8.2]; and to Visṇu with the mantra "Visnu traversed this..." [TS 1.2.13.1-2].

232. Then he should make a fourth offering to all living beings. He should make offerings the size of a mouthful to the sun and so forth in the proper order.

233. An ascetic who gathers daily the food belonging to others and makes offerings of it commits a sin and has to perform a penance.54 234. For what reason should he give alms? And what reward does he reap by giving? Both the one who gives and the one who receives will go to hell.

235. Hārīta: Placing the begging bowl in his left hand, he should take the lid off and clasp the bowl with his right.

236. He should beg as much almsfood as would satisfy his hunger. Returning, then, he should set down the bowl and sip some water in full control of himself.

237. Taking a mouthful of food mixed with all the condiments, an amount that would cover the four fingers, he should place it separately in the bowl with a collected mind.

238. He should then make offerings of food to the deities beginning with the sun and to living beings. Sprinkling the food with water, the ascetic should silently eat the food from a plate made of leaves but never out of the begging bowl.

53. The text does not specify the identity of the two sets of four. The first set clearly refers to the sun, Brahma, Viṣṇu, and living beings. The second set appears to include gods, ancestors, and human beings.

54. The Sanskrit "tyajati" means literally "he abandons or discards." Within the context, it refers in all likelihood to the "abandonment" of food in a sacrifice or oblation; the depositing of a sacrificial offering is often referred to as its abandonment (tyaga). These offerings may include oblations to ancestors and alms to other people; see Ch. 6.251-52.

6. Daily Practices 239. However, he should never eat from a plate made of the leaves of the following: banyan, sun plant, bo tree, Kumbhi plant, and Tinduka and Karañja trees. 55 240. Even in an emergency, however, he should never eat out of a brass plate. All ascetics who eat out of brass plates are referred to by the name Palāśa,56 241. An ascetic who eats out of a brass plate takes upon himself all the sins of both the tinker who made it and the householder who owns it.

242. Yama: Vessels made of gold or iron are not appropriate bowls for ascetics either for collecting alms or for eating.

243. When almsfood is put in a bowl made of gold, silver, copper, brass, or iron, the donor gets no merit and the receiver goes to hell.

244-45. Likhita: He should neither eat out of the begging bowl nor use the bowl to sip water. In the Kita, Tretā, and Dvāpara ages an ascetic may eat directly out of his begging bowl, but in the Kali age he should not eat out of the bowl or carry a pot [see Ch. 3.70 n. 31]. He should rather eat from a plate made of leaves but never put the food on the back side of the leaves 246-47. When the leaves of Palasa,57 lotus, or banana are unavailable, he should forgo eating. Even when other leaves are unavailable, he should refrain from eating food placed on Kusa or some other type of grass or on the ground, or out of vessels made of gold, silver, brass, copper, iron, or a part of an animal [see Ch. 6.130 n. 44].

248. He may eat off of a Palasa leaf or, in an emergency, directly out of his hand. A householder who eats off of a Palasa or a lotus leaf should observe a lunar fast [see Ch. 5.11 n. 5]. An ascetic and a forest hermit who do so, however, reap the reward of a lunar fast.

249. Medhātithi: A mendicant does not commit a sin by eating from plates made of gold, silver, copper, brass, shell, or stone; he does commit a sin if he accepts any of them.

117 250. Yama and Likhita intend to point out that an ascetic is not allowed to take for his own use, whether it is to collect almsfood or for eating, vessels made of gold and the like. Medhātithi's view, on the 55. The respective botanical names of these are Ficus indica, Calotropis gigantea, Ficus religiosa, Bignonia suaveolens (the name Kumbhi, however, applies to a variety of trees), Diospyros embryopteris, and Pongamia glabra.

56. A class of demons (Rākṣasa) are known by the name Palāśa, which literally means "flesh eater." 57. Butea frondosa.

118 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism other hand, is that an ascetic commits no sin when in an emergency he takes for his own use such vessels and eats from them, so long as they belong to someone else. When even such vessels belonging to others are unavailable, he should eat directly out of his hand. One should not eat from vessels made of brass and the like merely because leaves are unavailable. Rather, one may eat from them only when there is an imminent danger of death,58 according to Harita's statement: "Even in an emergency, however..." [Ch. 6.240]. 251. Atri gives the rule regarding the disposal of the food offerings: He should not give a food offering to a needy person or throw it away as he pleases. A wise man should throw it in water or bury it in the ground.

252. Kratu speaks about giving almsfood to others and about the disposal of that food when the ascetic is prevented from eating it:59 A person who collects almsfood in the manner of a bee and then gives it to Brahmins goes to a terrible hell; one who eats such food should observe a lunar fast.

253. Almsfood is permitted to twice-born people when they are performing a penance or a vow and in a time of distress. For others such a gift constitutes a theft, while for ascetics it is equal to a sacrifice.

254. Śandilya declares that ascetics should eat only once a day: Going to a village in the evening, he should silently collect almsfood. Just once every day he should eat eight mouthfuls of food.

255. Jābāli the Elder: He should never eat at night or eat again after he has eaten. A renouncer who eats at night undoubtedly falls.

256. If, after the time for the twilight worship has passed, an ascetic eats at night, all his religious activities-worship, silent prayer, control of breath, and food offerings-will become fruitless; a penance is ordained for him.

257. Vasistha speaks about eating twice: He may eat in the morning and in the evening what he receives from a Brahmin household, with the exception of honey and meat. He should not eat until he becomes satiated. [VaDh 10.24-25] This provision applies to the infirm.

58. The meaning is that an ascetic who fears that he will die if he continues to fast may eat to save his life and do so even from a forbidden vessel.

59. The text here appears to be corrupt, and the manuscripts give widely divergent readings. The two verses that follow deal only with the prohibition about giving away almsfood. They do not deal with the disposal of uneaten food.6. Daily Practices Rites Following the Meal 119 258. Next, I explain the rites that follow the meal. In this regard, Saunaka states: After eating he should sip some water and silently recite the mantra "May my speech be in my mouth, my breath in my nose..."[TS 5.5.9.2]. Then, after sipping water, he should worship the sun with the mantra "As we gaze from the darkness. . ." [TS 4.1.7.4], clean the bowl with water and a cord of cow's hair while reciting the seven Great Utterances, control his breath three times, and silently recite the Gayatri verse one hundred and eight times. He should spend the rest of the time engaged in silent prayer and meditation. Then, at the evening twilight when the sun has set, he should silently recite the Gayatri verse while he is seated until the stars appear. Thereafter, he should meditate until he falls asleep. He should meditate also when he is awakened from sleep.

259. Yama: Things made of gold and silver, vessels used in sacrifices, and the bowls of ascetics the rule is that these are purified with just water.

260. Likhita: After worshipping the sun following his meal, he should always read the Purānas. Reading the Puranas purifies the heart and thus develops the love of Viṣṇu.

261. Śankha and Likhita: A begging bowl may be made of one of the following: wood, gourd, cane, and clay. It is cleaned using water and a cord of cow's hair. It is to be cleaned every day. While he does this, it is not necessary to sip water. He should not throw the bowl on the ground or permit it to come into contact with something impure. After the meal he should sip water, sip once again, and sprinkle water on the articles.60 It is not inconsistent to carry a sling of cord, in the same way as other articles.61 262. Śankha: After worshipping the sun following his meal and sitting down on his seat, he should control his breath, silently recite the Gayatri verse one hundred and eight times, and again meditate on Nārāyaṇa.

263. He should spend the rest of the day reading the Puranas and occupied in other similar activities. Then, after performing the evening twilight worship, he should engage in yogic exercises; he should do so also when he wakes from sleep.

60. The Sanskrit term "dravyāṇi" is rather vague. In all likelihood, the water is sprinkled on the ascetic's belongings, such as the bowl.

61. This elliptical sentence is far from clear. The meaning may be that, as an ascetic is permitted to possess other articles, so he is permitted also to have a sling for carrying the water pot.

1,20 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 264. When every day a man thus performs meditation as his principal activity but also does his ritual duties, he is fit for becoming Brahman. 265. Visvamitra: After his meal he should worship the sun with the mantra "As we gaze from the darkness..." [TS 4.1.7.4]. I have declared the five ways of begging for mendicants [see Ch. 6.80].

266. A mendicant who lives in this manner is truly an ascetic; he truly belongs to an order of life. After performing the twilight worship in the prescribed manner, he should engage in meditation.

267. The morning twilight worship is performed using the verses addressed to Mitra; the midday worship, using the verses addressed to the sun; and the evening worship, using the verses addressed to Varuna.62 268. The twilight worship of the rising sun is known as Sarasvati, while the midday worship is called Sankarī, and the evening worship, Vaisnavī. 269. A Brahmin, if he is wise, should always perform the meditation in this manner. This meditation has been taught by me for achieving success in silent prayer and sacrifice.

270. If a man performs the twilight worship wearing purificatory rings made of cow's hair, every evil deed he has performed will be washed away at once.

271. Seated facing the east on Darbha grass and holding Darbha grass in his hands, he should recite the Gayatri verse one thousand times or one hundred times with a fully collected mind.

272. The three immaculate Great Utterances preceded by OM and the Gayatri with three feet-these are known as the highest state.

273. He should always wear a purificatory ring made of Kusa grass in his right hand, especially when he is eating. He is thus not defiled by the flaws in the food.

274. Wearing a sacrificial string and a top knot, carrying a triple staff, and furnished with a seat and a water pot, he should perform all the rites prescribed in the Vedas and the scriptures. An ascetic achieves success if he always performs yoga; he does not achieve it by any other means.

275. Medhātithi: After his meal he should himself wash his bowl with water and a cord of cow's hair as he recites the Great Utterances, the Gayatri verse, or the syllable OM.

62. For the verses addressed to Mitra and Varuna, see Ch. 6.47. According to the Bodhayaniyabrahmakarmasamuccaya, p. 54, the mantras to be recited at midday are the following five: "As we gaze from the darkness..." (TS 4.1.7.4). "His rays raise him up...." "The bright face of the gods..." (TS 1.4.43.1). "That eye favorable to the gods ," and "Who arose from the mighty ocean..." (TA 4.42.5).

6. Daily Practices 276. Then he should control his breath three times and silently recite the Gayatri verse one hundred and eight times. If he needs to speak at all, he should say only something useful.

277. He should then calmly spend the rest of the day in meditation. He should engage in twilight worship when the sun glows red until the appearance of stars.

278. He should again engage in meditation until he falls asleep. When he wakes from sleep he should meditate again and, while standing, silently recite again the mantras of the morning twilight worship.

279. Bharadvāja: After sipping a handful of water, saying, "You are the cover of ambrosia," he should brush his teeth while reciting OM. He should throw the remainder of the food together with the plate into water, sip some water, control his breath three times, sip water again, and silently recite the mantra "May my speech be in my mouth, my breath in my nose. . ." [TS 5.5.9.2]. He should then sprinkle himself with the mantra "Waters you bring delight" [RV 10.9.1-3] and carry out the worship with the mantra "As we gaze from the darkness..." [TS 4.1.7.4]. Then, he should wash his begging bowl while reciting OM, silently recite the Gayatri verse one hundred and eight times, and, taking a cord of cow's hair, rub the dry begging bowl with it while he again recites OM. After tying it as he recites the mantra "The quarters, the directions..." [TS 1.3.10.2], he should set the bowl down while reciting the Gayatri verse and worship the sun glowing red. A mendicant who thus takes his meal in the prescribed manner attains the highest goal.

Evening Duties 121 280. I describe next the evening twilight worship. On this point Saunaka writes: Rites such as bathing are done in the evening in the same way as before. After completing that entire set of rites, he should make an offering of water to the sun glowing red in the same manner as before.

281. Then he should worship the sun with the verses addressed to Varuna and complete the rites connected with twilight worship. Remaining seated, he should engage in meditation until he becomes sleepy. If he awakens he should again meditate. Such a man is fit for becoming Brahman.

282. Hārīta specifies the place where an ascetic should spend the night: After eating in the bowl, he should wash it while reciting a mantra. That bowl of his is not defiled like a cup at a sacrifice.

122 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 283. Then, after sipping some water and controlling his breath, he should worship the sun. He should spend the rest of the day engaged in silent prayer, meditation, and reading the epics. Then, after performing the twilight worship, he should spend the night in a temple or a similar place. 284. Śāṇḍilya: He should renounce all ritual activities, with the exception of the Veda. Building a hut outside the village, then, he should live there or at the foot of a tree.

285. Kratu: Free from attachments and doubts, undefiled and practicing yoga, he should live in a deserted house, a cave, a fire stall, or a temple.

286. Vasistha speaks about the prohibition of couches and the like, the covering for the body, and the obligation to sleep on the ground: He should always spend the night wearing a single garment, covering his body with an antelope skin or with grass that has been nibbled by cows, and sleeping on the ground.63 He should do so in the outskirts of the village, in a temple, in a deserted house, or at the foot of a tree. Mentally rehearsing his daily vedic recitation, he should always live in the wilderness and not roam in the vicinity of village cattle. [VaDh 10.9-16] 287. The same author comments: He should not eat until he becomes satiated. He may live within a village. He should not be crooked, deceitful, or irresolute. [VaDh 10.25-27] 288. Dakṣa addresses the issue of living without a companion and the question of who is entitled to live in a religious house and who is not: One is a true mendicant, two are said to form a sexual pair, and three are called a village. When they are more than that, they constitute a city.

289. A mendicant should not form a city, a village, or even a pair. If an ascetic forms these three, he falls from his duty.

290. In such groups gossip about kings, almsfood, and the like become rampant. Close association inevitably breeds love, calumny, and envy toward each other.

291. Mendicants who have become weak by performing austerities and silent prayers, who are sick or old, who are under evil planetary influence, and who suffer from a physical handicap are entitled to live in a religious house.

63. The critical edition of the VaDh has the reading anityām vasatim vaset, which translates as "He should not have a stable residence." In the citation by Yadava, however, the passage is intended to show how an ascetic should spend the night, hence my somewhat nonliteral translation of nityam vasatim vaset as "he should always spend the night." In this context, moreover, covering the body appears to refer to an ascetic substitute for a bed sheet.

6. Daily Practices 292. A mendicant who is healthy and young is not entitled to live in a religious house. If, for example, such a mendicant engages in sexual activity while living in a religious house, he defiles that place and also causes distress to the old people living there.

123 293. Kapila, on the other hand, approves of living with companions: He should greet respectfully teachers, old people, and those given to austerities who visit him. He should regard them as Viṣṇu himself. The practice of sharing what he has with them according to his ability in the performance of religious rites is also recommended as praiseworthy. He should live in the company of ascetics who are not cantankerous and follow common customs.

294. Śaunaka: He should neither build a house himself nor have one built for him. He should occupy one that is already built. Then, he should meditate on Brahman and keep his mind focused only on Brahman as he falls asleep. Or he may enter a temple free of heretics and somehow spend the night there, either keeping awake or sleeping. Then, sitting down, he should sip some water, control his breath three times, and sip again. At night he should sip water taken from a water pot placed on a wooden plank, while during the day he should use flowing water. He should not leave a holy place that is pleasant and has a lot of water. He should not develop an intense attachment to a sacred bathing place.

295. Vayu: At the end of the night water is to be drawn in the prescribed manner into a clean pot. He should himself throw away water that has remained in a pot a day and a night, even though it may be pure.

Behavior toward Ascetics 296. Next, I will explain what a householder should do when a mendicant visits him for food or lodging. In this connection, Jābāli the Elder writes: Even though a Brahmin may have mastered all four Vedas, offered Soma sacrifices, and performed a hundred sacrifices, an ascetic is far superior to him; they are as different as a sesame seed and Mount Meru.

297. If a man does not get up from his bed or chair when he sees an ascetic, on account of that deed that foolish man will be reborn in animal wombs after death.

298. One should not denigrate an ascetic, be he virtuous or sinful. People who are malevolent toward ascetics end up in hell.

124 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 299. Dattatreya: A Brahmin who carries the emblem of the triple staff is Nārāyaṇa himself in visible form. So, when a man worships him, he thereby worships Visnu himself.

300. Non-mendicants should worship a mendicant who is totally devoted to his duties, irrespective of whether he is virtuous or vile, or whether he has taken his vows a long time ago or just recently.64 301. An ascetic who carries the triple staff is an image of Visṇu. One should always worship him with a devout heart using the eight-syllable mantra containing the name of Nārāyaṇa.6 302. The triple staff is the emblem of Visnu. It is the means of liberation for twice-born people and signals the cessation of all rules [see Ch. 2.51 n. 203. That is the teaching of the Veda.

303. The law contained in the triple Veda was once assaulted by Buddhists, heretics, and the followers of Kanāda, and it was protected by Visnu carrying a triple staff (see Ch. 1.2 n. 11.

304. Jamadagni: If someone gives to an ascetic food that has dried out and that had been cooked separately, the fool will go to hell on account of that sin.

305. An ascetic and a vedic student are both entitled to receive cooked food. If a man eats without giving food to these two, he should observe a lunar fast.

306. One should first pour water on the ascetic's hand, then give the almsfood, and finally pour water on his hand again. That almsfood is equal to Mount Meru, and that water is comparable to the ocean.

307. Visṇu himself eats in the house of a man where an ascetic eats. The triple world eats in the house of a man where Visṇu eats.

308. All the sins that a householder may have accumulated during his entire life are reduced to ashes when an ascetic spends a single night with him.

309. If a man ignores those who do not cook and feeds people who do cook, all his labor with regard to divine and ancestral rites will be in vain. 310. If a man turns away a good ascetic who is neither defiled nor sinful, he will hand over his merits to that ascetic and take over the ascetic's sins. 311. Whether he is a saint or a sinner, a fool or a sage, an ascetic should be honored, O Yudhisthira, even if he simply wears an ocher robe and carries a staff.

64. I have tried to make some sense of this somewhat unclear and possibly corrupt verse by assuming an avagraha before bhikṣubhih.

65. This mantra is om namo nārāyaṇāya-"OM Homage to Nārāyaṇa!" 6. Daily Practices 312. Atri: One who is giving the almsfood should first pour water on the mendicant's right hand and then put the almsfood in the bowl that is carried in his left hand.

313. The pouring of water while giving almsfood has been ordained to satiate the gods and ancestors. They become sated indeed when that food is given.

314. Even if a man gives the entire earth, it would not equal the merit of preparing almsfood and giving it to a mendicant, who is an image of Visnu.

315. When man gives to a renouncer a begging bowl, a seat, a staff, a sling, or a water strainer, he reaps the reward of giving a cow.

316. If a man builds a hermitage to house sick mendicants or cares for them with healthy food and the like, he obtains an eternal reward.

317. Jābāli the Elder: Almsfood that has been kept aside, licked by cats and mice, left open to the wind, or dried up is equal to honey and meat.

318. The person who accepts almsfood that is stale or that had been previously offered to gods does not commit sin, but the donor goes to hell.

319. One should first pour water on the mendicant's hand, then give the almsfood, and finally pour water on his hand again. That almsfood is equal to mountains, and that water is comparable to the ocean. Almsfood given in this manner satiates the gods.

320. Jābāli: If a man ever robs something from the hands of an ascetic, the fool will go to hell on account of that sinful deed.

321. When a man gives to a renouncer a triple staff, a water strainer, a begging bowl, or a seat, he reaps the reward of giving a thousand cows.

322-23. When a man gives to a triple-staffed ascetic a begging bowl of one of the four kinds furnished with all requisites after filling it with sacrificial food and offers himself as well, he rescues all those abject sinners who are burning in hell and, raising himself by himself, attains the highest state.

324. As many bowls and as much food as he gives, for that many thousands of years he will rejoice in heaven.

325. That ends the sixth chapter, entitled "Daily Practices," of the Collection of Ascetic Laws.

125 CHAPTER SEVEN Proper Conduct 1. Now I will explain the rules of proper conduct. Manu writes in this connection: A sage should live without fire or house and enter a village to obtain food. He should remain disinterested, not acquisitive, and mentally composed. [MDh 6.43] 2. A begging bowl, dwelling at the foot of a tree, ragged clothes, a solitary life, and equanimity toward all-these are the marks of a renouncer.1 [MDh 6.44] 3. Let him long neither for death nor for life and await his appointed time, as a servant awaits his wages. [MDh 6.45] 4. He should place his foot on the ground after determining its purity by inspection. He should drink water that has been purified with a cloth strainer. He should speak words that are pure because true. And he should conduct himself with a pure heart. [MDh 6.46] 5. Let him bear insults patiently and never treat anyone with contempt. Let him, moreover, never quarrel with anyone just for the sake of this body. [MDh 6.47] 6. Toward a man who is angry at him let him not show anger in return; let him say kind words to those who revile him. In connection with any of the seven doors,2 moreover, let him not speak an untrue word. [MDh 6.48] 7. Finding joy in activities pertaining to his inner self, he should sit in meditation, free from concerns and desires, and go about alone during the day for the sake of bodily comforts.3 [MDh 6.49] 1. Manu uses the term moksa (lit., "liberation") as a technical term for the order of life (aśrama) devoted to liberation, namely renunciation (see Ch. 2.5). The term "mukta" (lit., "liberated") thus refers to one who has renounced. The most appropriate translations of these two terms, therefore, are "renunciation" and "renouncer." For a more detailed discussion of Manu's use of this term, see Olivelle 1993, 137-42.

2. The identity of the seven doors is uncertain, and the commentators of Manu offer a variety of interpretations. The seven are most likely the five senses, together with the mind and the intellect; see Ch. 5.40-41.

3. I interpret the elliptic phrase "sukhārtham" as search for bodily comforts, such as food. The reason ascetics go about during the day is to beg for food, and the 126 7. Proper Conduct 8. He should never seek to obtain almsfood by interpreting portents and omens, by practicing astrology or palmistry, by giving advice, or by participating in debates. [MDh 6.50] 9. Let him not visit a house crowded with hermits, Brahmins, birds, or dogs, or even with other mendicants. [MDh 6.51] 10. He should always disdain food given with a great show of respect, for when he accepts such food, even a liberated ascetic slips into bondage. [MDh 5.58] 11. By eating little and by living in an isolated place he should restrain his senses as they are being drawn by sensual things. [MDh 6.59] 12. By bringing his senses under control, by eradicating love and hate, and by not causing harm to any creature, he becomes fit for immortality. [MDh 6.60] 13. Let him reflect on the diverse destinies of people resulting from evil deeds, their descent into hell, and their suffering in Yama's abode. [MDh 6.61] 14. Let him reflect on how they are separated from the ones they love and united with the ones they hate and on how they are overtaken by old age and oppressed by disease. [MDh 6.62] 15. Let him reflect on how they depart from this body and start a new life in a womb and on how this inner self migrates through untold millions of wombs. [MDh 6.63] 16. Let him reflect on how the embodied souls are subjected to suffering on account of sins and how they experience unending happiness by pursuing righteous goals. [MDh 6.64] 17. Let him reflect on the subtle nature of his inner self through yogic concentration and on how it takes birth in the most excellent of bodies, as well as in the vilest. [MDh 6.65] 18. Viṣṇu: Respect and disrespect-these two produce joy and anger in people, but in promoting the success of those engaged in yogic practice, their effects are exactly the opposite.4 19. Respect and disrespect-they call these two poison and ambrosia. Of the two, disrespect is ambrosia, while respect is deadly poison.

20. The same author states further on: 127 very next verse deals with begging. The editions of MDh read "iha" ("in this world") for "diva," and most commentators of Manu take the phrase to mean the desire to attain the bliss of final liberation.

4. This and the following verses ascribed to Visṇu are found in the forty-first chapter of the Markandeya Purāṇa.

.128 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism Let a yogin, his mind concentrated, behave in such a way that people would scorn and despise him, taking care not to cause harm to the practices of good men.

21. Once again the same author states: He should engage in that essential activity by which he will attain liberation, for other rites in numerous ways create obstacles on the path of yoga. 22. Abandoning all rites that are either voluntary or forbidden, let him practice just the obligatory rites.

23. Yama: If one man rubs sandalwood paste on his right arm, while another cuts off his left, he should look upon them with equal eyes.

24. This should always be his disposition in the face of pleasant and unpleasant things. Under all circumstances, whether desirable or disagreeable, he should always remain the same.

25. He should be the same to friend and foe, to the good and to the bad; freed from attachments, he should remain the same in cold and heat, in pleasure and pain.

26. He is neither elated when he is praised nor angered when he is abused. A man who is the same when he is loved or hated is a sage without desire for anything.

27. When a man is neither elated nor dejected at anything he might hear, touch, see, taste, or smell, he should be regarded as one who has vanquished his senses.

28. He should not be fickle in anything he does, whether it be with his hands, feet, eyes, or speech. That is the mark of a cultivated man.

29. The same author likewise states: Food that is pure, that comes from a pure source, and that is not especially savory produces a pure mind, while impure food produces an impure mind.

30. The body is a lump of flesh and blood, a pile of marrow, fat, and bones. Equipped with hair and nails, it contains fat and other kinds of filth.

31-32. Enveloped by skin and filled with urine and feces, it stinks. An abode for the winds and a vessel of impurities, the body is without substance, like a picture on a wall or foam on water. Containing both perishable and imperishable parts, it is a place for collecting love and hate.

33-34. The body is like a fort with a single column, nine gates, and three pillars. It is constructed with the five elements. Joys are its ramparts; the 5. Winds constitute one of the three bodily humors, the other two being bile and phlegm.7. Proper Conduct mind is its mighty ruler. The ten senses are the soldiers who surround it, diseases are the wild beasts that infest it, and the potent sense objects are the powerful provinces that attack it, as it is being ruled by the intellect.6 35. The body is the painful abode of disease, subject to old age and sorrow. Let a man abandon this impure and impermanent dwelling place of elements.

36. Bathing, silent prayer, meditation, purification, light meals-only a man who performs these five will become liberated.

37. He should engage in the daily practice of listening to the Purāṇas with devotion, for by listening to the Purānas even a fool acquires devotion.

38. Devotion that continues uninterrupted brings release. Therefore, one should recite the Puranas. By reciting them a sage attains the state of the supreme Brahman.

39. Vasistha: A wandering ascetic should set out after giving a promise of safety to all creatures [VaDh 10.1]. Now they also cite these verses: When a sage goes about after giving a promise of safety to all creatures, he too will have nothing ever to fear from any creature. [VaDh 10.2] 40. But if he takes to the ascetic life without giving a promise of safety to all creatures, he kills creatures born and yet to be born, as he does also when he accepts gifts. [VaDh 10.3] 41. The single syllable OM is the highest Brahman, and the control of breath is the highest austerity. Eating almsfood is better than fasting, and compassion is superior to giving gifts. [VaDh 10.5] 42. Likewise, the same authors state later on: He keeps his emblem and his conduct concealed. Although sane, he assumes the appearance of a madman. Now, they also cite these verses: Liberation is not possible for individuals who are passionately devoted to grammar, who delight in captivating people's hearts, who are preoccupied with food and clothing, or who are fond of lovely houses. [VaDh 10.18-20] 43. He should never study, or speak, or even listen. No one but a man who is already equipped with these qualities is an ascetic.

44. If, after assuming the ascetic life, a man fails to live according to its rules, the king should brand him with the mark of a dog's foot and expel him from the kingdom.

129 6. Some of these analogies are easy to follow. The single column is probably the spine; the nine gates are the openings of the eyes, ears, nostrils, mouth, anus, and urinary canal; and the three pillars the three strands of goodness, energy, and dark- ness.

130 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 45. Further on, he states: They expound teachings and acquire disciples for profit and adulation. These and other similar tricks, great in number, are used by false ascetics. 46. Meditation, purification, mendicancy, living always in solitudethese are the four activities of a mendicant, and there is no fifth.

47. A person would undertake the recitation of texts and the study of a lot of books only if he regards something in this world as a second reality besides himself 48. A twice-born man should depart for the ascetic life after he has deposited his sacred fire in himself. He should always be devoted to the recitation of the Vedas and intent on gaining the knowledge of the self. 49. After he has followed all the orders of life, overcome anger, and vanquished his senses, a twice-born man who has come to know the meaning of the Vedas will attain the world of Brahma. The rule of lifelong commitment is prescribed with regard to all the orders of life.7 50. Śātātapa: If an ascetic lapses after he has assumed the final duty, I cannot see a penance that would purify that slayer of the self.8 51. If, after he has become a wandering ascetic, a man becomes a householder once again, he will be reborn as a worm living in excrement for sixty thousand years.

52. After he has formally declared in this world his intention to renounce, if a man does not carry out the rite of renunciation, he will sink into the depth of darkness, consumed by the fire of his false promise.

53. If, after he has become a wandering ascetic, a man continues to engage in sexual activity, he will be reborn as a worm living in excrement for sixty thousand years.

54. Then he will become a horrible mouse living in frightful abandoned houses. Soon he will reenter a womb9 and be reborn as a dog during twelve lifetimes.

55. He will then become a vulture for twenty years and a pig for nine, after which he will be reborn as a tree full of thorns without flowers or fruits.

7. The meaning appears to be that a person may legitimately decide to spend all his life following the duties of any one order of life. For this provision and for the history of the institution of the four orders of life (aśrama), see Olivelle 1993.

8. "The final duty" refers to any lifelong vocation, such as perpetual studentship. In ascetic literature it often refers specifically to the renunciatory state that is both lifelong and final, because it is the last order of life. The expression atmahā, here translated as "slayer of the self," can also mean a suicide.

9. This may imply that becoming a mouse does not involve conception in a womb. Mice may have been imagined as spontaneously produced within piles of rubbish.

7. Proper Conduct 56. Thereafter, he will becomes the stump of an Aśoka tree burnt by a forest fire, and he will remain without consciousness for one thousand years. 57. At the end of those one thousand years he will be born as a demonic Brahmin tormented by hunger and thirst, eating raw flesh, and drinking blood. He will gain release gradually from that state, but at the cost of his family's destruction.

58. A man who causes the apostasy of a renouncer, a man who admits a fallen man into renunciation, and a man who places obstacles on the path of renunciation-all these three the scriptures declare to be fallen.10 59. There are outcaste Canḍālas called Bindula, who wear the outward marks of wandering ascetics.11 Children born to them should be made to live with Caṇḍālas.

60. Hārīta: After a man has performed the rite of renunciation with full knowledge and in the prescribed manner, if he again becomes a householder, he is indeed an apostate and is excluded from all religious activities.

61. If a man forsakes the ascetic life to become a householder once again, he will be reborn as a worm living in excrement for sixty thousand years. 62. The text from here onward follows the reading of Śātātapa.12 An apostate kills ten generations of his ancestors before him and ten generations of his descendants after him, while those same generations are rescued by a twice-born ascetic who remains faithful to his vows.

63. Therefore, an ascetic should make every effort to carry the triple staff. If he faithfully carries out the duties of an ascetic, he will not be born again on earth.

64. The triple-staffed ascetic belongs to the highest of all the order's of life. He should indeed be worshipped with devotion by people who follow the true path.

65. A Brahmin who carries the emblem of the triple staff is Nārāyaṇa himself in visible form. When a man worships him, he thereby worships Visnu himself.

66. An ascetic who carries the triple staff is an image of Viṣṇu. One should always worship him with a devout heart using the eight-syllable mantra containing the name of Nārāyaṇa [see Ch. 6.301 n. 65].

131 10. The meaning of "fallen" (patita) in this type of literature is always rather vague. In its strict legal sense, this term refers to a man who has fallen from his caste due to a serious sin or violation of caste rules. In a broader sense, it may refer to anyone guilty of a major crime or sin.

11. The statement does not clearly identify these people. It may refer to people who claim to be ascetics but live with families. Many such groups of householder ascetics are recorded in Indian history. See Bouiller 1979; Derrett 1974.

12. The author appears to omit a section of Hārīta's passage that follows verbatim the text of Śātātapa given above; see Ch. 7.51.

132 1 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 67-68. I have thus explained to you, O Brahmins, this eternal path of truth. But when the age of Kali comes, there will arise ascetics wearing vile emblems different from this. They will all be inflamed by the fire of Gautama. 13 In the Kali age, moreover, they will explain the meaning of the Veda in an entirely different way.

69. These naked ascetics are Buddhists in disguise, and they will revile the triple Veda. These dimwits will recite the Upanisads at night.

70. "We are liberated!"-with this conviction, they will eat the food of Sūdras. In the age of Kali they will sway even those who are committed to the duties proper to them.

71. There are many twice-born men who gain a living by the strategy of carrying a single staff. Because they have forsaken rites, they fall into the dreadful Raurava hell, 14 72. Therefore, let a wise man not talk with, or even look at, such ascetics. When someone looks at them, he is purified by looking at the sun.

fa 73. If a man feeds a twice-born ascetic who is naked or who is without a sacrificial string at a funerary repast, he thereby offers to his ancestors semen, urine, and excrement.

74. If a man resorts to a single staff either because he has been talked into it or because of greed and afterward regains the spirit of detachment, he should carry a triple staff like a wise man.

75. Parāśara: These two men go through the sun splitting its orb apart-a wandering ascetic who is absorbed in meditation and a soldier who goes fearlessly to death in battle.

76. When it sees a twice-born man who has renounced, the sun swerves from its place, thinking, "This man will split my orb and proceed to the highest Brahman." [see Ch. 4.16 n. 18] 77. Katyāyana: He should avoid love, hatred, and other such faults all his life. An ascetic who always lives in this manner will reach Brahman..

78. Uśanas: Casting off all attachments, overcoming hatred, eating little, and subduing his senses, he should shut his doors [see Ch. 7.6 n. 2) with his intellect and turn his mind to meditation.

13. This is clearly a reference to Buddhist ascetics, although Brahmanical ascetic literature of this period tends to conflate all types of non-Brahmanical ascetics into a single category.

14. This verse touches on the medieval controversy between the Advaita ascetic tradition, which prescribed a single staff, and the Sri-Vaisnava ascetics, who carried triple staffs. The latter often accused the Advaitins of being Buddhists pretending to follow the Brahmanical law. On this controversy, see Olivelle 1986-87.

7. Proper Conduct 133 79. Vyasa: Casting off all attachments and possessing the knowledge of all things, he should practice zealously all that I have taught before regarding the knowledge of the self.

80. A man whose mind is set on the self should make every effort to shun worldly affairs. He should fervently recite the various Upanisads that bring about liberation.

81. Apastamba: Next, the rules for a wandering ascetic. Immediately thereafter, 15 from the state of a vedic student, he departs as a wandering ascetic. For such a person they prescribe the following. A sage should live without fire or house, without comfort or protection. He speaks only at his daily vedic recitation. Gathering from a village just enough food to sustain his life, let him wander about without longing for anything in this world or the next. (ApDh 2.21.7-10] 82. Bṛhaspati: Householders observe the vow of celibacy by being faithful to their wives, whereas total abstinence is demanded of those who belong to the other three orders of life.

83. Later on the same author states: He should not mingle with his relatives, children, friends, and the like, or with eminent men among the twice-born people, even when he meets them in a different region. Such mingling will undoubtedly lead to lust, hatred, and the like.

84. The same author further states: An ascetic should not live permanently at a sacred bathing place or devote himself totally to fasting, study, or teaching.

85. Śankha: If one man rubs sandalwood paste on one of his arms while another cuts off his other arm, he should not feel kindly toward the one and unkindly toward the other. With a friendly disposition and seeking the welfare of all creatures, he regards a clod, a stone, and a piece of gold as the same. 86. Likhita: He should not be fond of books that do not deal with spiritual matters or become an astrologer. He should not treat people who are sick, poisoned, or possessed, even if it is done for a religious reason.

87. He should not gather a lot of disciples, broadcast his knowledge, or speak in Sanskrit, but should go about like a simpleton and a mute.

15. This means he departs immediately after completing the period of studentship following vedic initiation. Regarding Apastamba's view on the time for becoming an ascetic, see Olivelle 1993, 74-82.

134 1 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 88. Later on the same author states: If, after he has renounced, a man observes the duties of an ascetic for three years, devoting himself continuously to yogic practice, he will attain liberation after death.

89. Therefore, a man should seek to attain sovereignty, the highest step of Viṣṇu. A twice-born man should enter the order devoted to liberation and seek to live in it for even a day.

90. Sankha and Likhita state: An ascetic should subsist on almsfood and not be fond of sharing it with others. He should avoid begging from public sinners and from people fallen from their caste and live on humble and disparaged food. He should be satisfied with wearing just a loincloth. With his passions totally extinguished, he awaits his appointed time, constantly absorbed in meditation. Finding delight in himself, he is in the habit of living in secluded places. Free from deception, hypocrisy, and deceit, he never resides in the same village. Giving up the faults inherent in attachment, he should cultivate the habit of wandering. Adept at understanding the self and distinguishing it from other things, he should not be fond of staying in one place outside the rainy season. He should perform the purifications after voiding urine and excrement, as well as the ritual sipping, with water that has been drawn out.

91. The same authors state further: When a man bears patiently the barbed words evil people may hurl at him and maintains a joyful spirit without getting angry, it constitutes his selfcontrol generated by his mind.

92. When a man bears patiently cold, heat, and other such dualities, as well as attacks by evil people, the scriptures call it patience and forbear- ance.

93. When a man has attained supreme wisdom and remains completely calm in the face of every event, whether it is desirable or undesirable, calamitous or propitious, he possesses tranquillity and self-control.

94. When man possessing austerity, knowledge, self-control, and power does not get angry at barbed and cutting words hurled at him-that wise man will not be confounded in this world.

95. If an ascetic with a gentle heart follows in this world the rules of the order devoted to liberation, he will soon cast off the bonds of rebirth and become fit for immortality.

96. The same authors state further: Avoiding people who have fallen from their castes and keeping his senses, speech, and eyes under control, he should beg almsfood from the four 7. Proper Conduct classes. Among these, however, he should avoid people of each lower class when those belonging to a higher one are available. 16 97. Dakṣa the Elder: An ascetic comes to possess a staff by acquiring the staffs of speech, mind, and deed and not just because he carries a bamboo stick.17 98. The staff of speech is the practice of silence, the staff of mind is the control of breath, and the staff of deed is not injuring any living being. 99. Kapila: An ascetic should abstain from uttering words of greeting or blessing. He should neither build a house himself nor have one built for him. He should occupy one that is already built. Then, he should meditate on Brahman and keep his mind focused only on Brahman as he falls asleep. Or he may enter a temple free of heretics and somehow spend the night there, either keeping awake or sleeping. Then, sitting down, he should sip some water, control his breath three times, and sip again. At night he should sip water taken from a water pot placed on a wooden plank, while during the day he should use flowing water. He should not leave a holy place that is pleasant and has a lot of water or be exceedingly attached to such a place. He should not be given to explaining epic and puranic texts. 100. Later on the same author states: If he is unable to bear the cold, 18 he may light a fire using pieces of wood that have fallen on their own from trees and that do not harbor insects. There is no fault in his eating roots and fruit that do not contain larvae. Let him not hurt anything, whether it has consciousness or not, for little cause. There is no fault in his possessing such things as a water pot, a water strainer, and metal articles given to him on loan. Let him not get angry even when he is provoked or become elated even when he is flattered. Let him desire neither to die nor to live. He should not throw away a bowl that is not damaged by fire. After answering a call of nature, he should immediately, without waiting even a moment, go to a nearby place of water to purify himself and silently recite the appropriate prayers.19 Then he should turn his mind to Visṇu. He should not, however, show partiality to one god. He should give up a dwelling that is in close proximity to others and has patrons. He should not continue looking when he sees a pretty woman but shut his eyes. He should recite OM and not become alarmed.

135 16. This is an expanded translation of the pithy statement following similar provisions given elsewhere; cf. Ch. 6.105.

17. The author plays on the dual meaning of the Sanskrit term "danda," both staff and control or punishment; see Ch. 4.34 n. 30.

18. Although cold is not mentioned, it appers to be implied.

19. As I have indicated in the critical edition, the readings preserved in the manuscripts are all corrupt. The translation given here is, therefore, very tentative.

136 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 101. The same author states further: An ascetic who seeks final bliss should vigilantly shut off all his senses, thereby erasing what he has perceived.

102. When a man is in the habit of singing songs of divine praise and is given to controlling his breath, then even the sins he may have committed during previous lifetimes cease to affect him at all.

103. Kratu: Destroying living organisms, using a metal bowl, ejaculating semen, wearing white clothes, sleeping during the day, and speaking idly-these are the seven causes of an ascetic's fall.

104. He should avoid things that have been stored for a long time, as well. as activities such as hoarding. Grass, earth, wood, water, stone, leaves, roots, and fruit-he should not take them unless they are given to him, and even when they are given, he should not accumulate them.20 105. Male and female slaves, houses, carriages, cows, fields, grain, money, and gold:21 by accepting such forbidden things a man destroys two hundred generations of his family.

106. Jābāli the Elder: An ascetic who is self-possessed should not attend receptions, ancestral rites, sacrifices, and events in honor of gods such as processions and festivals, as well as any kind of entertainment.

107. Further on the same author states: An ascetic who is intent on giving gifts, as well as one who accumulates clothes and other such goods-both will end up in the putrid hell because of their stupidity.

108. Dattatreya: If, after he has taken up the emblem of Visnu, a man foolishly abandons it, he will go to a hell that is fearsome, violent, narrow, and cruel. 109. Devala: These are the rules of an ascetic-to regard friend and foe alike; not to accumulate possessions; to practice celibacy; to behave in a pleasant manner; to keep himself pure; not to participate in occupations and arts; and to avoid jewels, money, grain, sensual enjoyments, social intercourse, jealousy, pride, duplicity, delusion, excitement, strife, astonishment, quarrels, fear, debate, and the like.

20. This verse is elliptical and unclear, and the reading may be corrupt. Mine is a tentative translation.

21. The meaning of the term "rasa" in this context is unclear. I have taken it to mean gold, because the list contains items commonly associated with wealth. The term can also mean, among other things, liquor or any sweet drink.

7. Proper Conduct 110. An ascetic should beg every day from the houses of virtuous householders food and medicine in such amounts as not to leave a surplus for the next day.

111. If an ascetic accepts for his own use an amount of food or medicine that is more than necessary for that day, he will go to hell.

112. He should accept things that are necessary to carry out his duties from good people who follow an active mode of life. Even by mistake he should not accept anything from those who follow a nonactive mode of life, 22 113. Garga: After giving up the duties of every other type of life, a man should take up the duties of an ascetic. Should he lapse from the duties of an ascetic, he will not receive the reward of any duty he may have performed.

114. Vasistha the Elder: He should avoid activities such as the following: plucking flowers or fruits, digging up roots, nipping the tips of leaves,23 eating honey or meat, and exchanging gifts.

115. Medhātithi: His possessions consist of the following six articles: triple staff, water pot, sling, begging bowl, seat, and loincloth.

116. As an ascetic would not accept urine and excrement, in the same way he should not accept these six things: movable and immovable property, seeds, metal utensils, poison, and weapons.

117. As a man would carry out a sentence handed down by the king, in the same way an ascetic should carry out the following six things: begging almsfood, silent prayer, bathing, meditation, purification, and divine worship.

118. As he would avoid the wife of another man, in the same way he should avoid the following: alchemy, judicial litigation, astrology, buying and selling, and all sorts of crafts.

119. As he would not look at excrement, in the same way he should not look at these six: dances and similar shows, gambling, young women, friends, festive foods, and menstruating women.

120. An ascetic should never live in these six types of places: royal courts, cities, trading posts, granaries, cattle farms, and houses.

137 22. Within the scheme of the four orders of life, householders belong to the first category and ascetics, and possibly also students, to the second. The position of hermits is unclear, for some sources permit begging from them, while others relate them closely with ascetic modes of life; see Ch. 6.150.

23. The meaning of "agra" is not altogether clear. One manuscript reads "tṛṇāgra" ("tips of grass"). The sense may be the breaking of the tips of branches, leaves, and the like.

138 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 121. These are the six causes of an ascetic's fall: traveling at night, traveling in carriages, talking about women, greed, sleeping on beds, and wearing white clothes.

122. An ascetic should never even think of these six: lust, hatred, pride, arrogance, hypocrisy, and malice toward others.

123. These six are the causes of an ascetic's bondage: residence, lack of a bowl, accumulation, gathering disciples, sleeping during the day, and idle speech.

124. When an ascetic spends more than one day in a village or five days in a city outside of the rainy season, that offense is called "residence." 125. When a mendicant who subsists on almsfood fails to acquire even one of the prescribed types of bowls, it is called "lack of a bowl." 126. When an ascetic takes an additional bowl, triple staff, or similar article for use in the future, it constitutes the "accumulation" of goods. 127. When an ascetic gathers disciples not out of compassion but for the services, profit, and honor they provide and the fame they would bring, it should be recognized as "gathering disciples." 128. Because of its lucidity, knowledge is called day, while ignorance is. called night. When someone is negligent in those practices that produce knowledge, he is said to be a man who "sleeps during the day." 129. Conversations relating to spiritual matters, asking for almsfood, divine praise, words of kindness, or asking the way-talking at times other than these is called "idle speech." 130. When he possesses these six qualities, an ascetic surely is called tongueless, a eunuch, lame, blind, deaf, and stupid.

131. When a man, as he eats, does not notice that one thing is tasty and another is not, or that one thing is hot and another is sweet, he is called a "tongueless" man.

132. When a man remains as unmoved when he sees a sixteen-year-old young lady as when he sees a newborn girl or a hundred-year-old woman, he is called a "eunuch." 133. When a man walks only to beg food and to answer nature's calls and even then does not travel beyond a league, he is called "lame." 134. When a wandering ascetic, as he stands or walks, does not look beyond six feet in front of him, unless there is some danger, he is said to be "blind." 135. Upon hearing words that are kind or unkind, soothing or scathing, when a man remains as if he had not heard them, he is said to be "deaf." 136. When in the presence of hostile people a mendicant remains silent and acts as if he were asleep, even though he has the full use of his faculties, he is said to be "stupid."24 24. The Sanskrit term "mugdha" means both stupor and stupidity.7. Proper Conduct 137. A person who knows these ten sets of six, who is endowed with the highest faith, and who is totally devoted to the Supreme Self will be freed from both the gross and the subtle bodies.

138. Jamadagni: The fool who plucks grains, breaks trees, creepers, or plants, or damages mobile or immobile creatures will go to hell.

139. One who eats a full meal given by a single person, one who accepts food twice, one who obtains a livelihood through mendicancy, and one who accepts food three times25-these four types of ascetics undoubtedly fall.

140.Ascetics, vedic students, and widows should abstain from chewing betel leaves, from anointing their bodies with oil, and from eating out of brass plates.

141. Liquor and betel leaves-these two are of equal strength. Therefore, an ascetic should make every effort to abstain from betel leaves.

142. Śaunaka: Let him not broadcast his virtues. Let him not get angry even when he is provoked or become elated even when he is honored. He should bathe in the morning, at noon, and in the evening, submerging in the water like a stick. Likewise, he should not jump in or swim across a river. Let him not desire to live or to die. He should not travel at night or at dawn and dusk. He should abstain from chewing betel leaves and not long to eat twice or to anoint his body with oil. He should not attend receptions, ancestral rites, and sacrifices, as well as processions and festivals in honor of gods. He should also avoid friendly contact with hermits and householders in trading posts or at places of assembly.

143. Paithīnasi: Let him neither rejoice when he is praised nor become angry when he is reviled. Discovering both to be the same through knowledge and austerity, let him live in total equanimity.

144. Satyakāma: After giving up the duties of every other type of life, a man should take up the duties of the life devoted to liberation. Should he lapse from the duties of the life devoted to liberation, he should perform a purificatory rite.

139 25. The meanings of these four categories, especially the second and the fourth, are very unclear. The term "dviprati" is, to my knowledge, unknown elsewhere. Even the editor of M considers this corrupt. I have attempted to derive it from "prati vi," meaning "to accept." Likewise, the term "trisamgrahi" is unclear; I have taken it as referring to a man who accept food either three times from the same house or three times a day.

140 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 145. He should not step on a spot that he has not inspected or travel along a road not pointed out by the sun.26 Let him not injure any living being in thought, word, or deed.

146. That ends the seventh chapter, entitled "Proper Conduct," of the Collection of Ascetic Laws.

26. The meaning is that he should travel without a specific destination, along the way pointed out by the sun.

CHAPTER EIGHT Rules on Insignia and Related Penances 1. Now I will explain the rules on insignia, such as shaving, as well as the penances associated with them. In this connection, Saunaka writes: He should have himself shaved at the junctures between seasons, without cutting his topknot or shaving the hair of his body.

2. Devala: The lunar day that falls between the fourteenth day of the bright lunar halfmonth and the first day of the dark half-month should be regarded as the juncture between two seasons. A person should have himself shaved on that day.1 3. Likhita: On every full-moon day falling at the juncture between seasons, except when it occurs during the four months of the rainy season, an ascetic should have his head shaved without cutting his topknot.

4. If he is sick or threatened by robbers, kings, and the like, or if he lacks the resources, he may have himself shaved on any day between the full moon and the fifth day of the dark half-month.

5. Now, the juncture between seasons should be regarded as the lunar day that falls between the fourteenth day of the bright lunar halfmonth and the first day of the dark half-month. The meaning is that he should undertake the shaving during the solar day on which falls the juncture between the fifteenth day of the bright half-month and the first day of the dark half-month.2 6. Devala: 1. The bright half-month begins with the new moon and the dark half-month with the full moon. An Indian season lasts two months and, according to this reckoning, begins on the day of the full moon of every other month.

2. A lunar day can begin and end at any time during a twenty-four-hour solar day, which according to the Indian reckoning begins not at midnight but at sunrise and concludes at the sunrise of the next day. The author wants to point out that the 141 142 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism Immediately after the conclusion of the four months of the rainy season, he should shave the hair of his head and his beard, but not the body hair below the neck.3 7. Manu: Self-controlled and not hurting any living being, let him always wander with his hair and beard shaved and his nails clipped, carrying a bowl, a staff, and a water pot. [MDh 6.52] 8. Devala: He should shave his head or, optionally, keep a topknot. If he thoughtlessly violates this rule, there is no doubt that he can be purified only by performing a Prājāpatya penance [see Ch. 4.2 n.1].

9. Gālava: If a man shaves the three places, he should perform a Prājāpatya penance and then control his breath one hundred times.

10. Jamadagni: An ascetic should perform a penance if he shaves his armpits, pubic region, and the like. He should perform three Prajapatya penances and then control his breath one hundred times.

11. This latter penance applies when one shaves the armpits, pubic region, and so forth together at the same time.5 Medhātithi: At the juncture between seasons he should get himself shaved, avoiding the armpits, the pubic region, and the topknot. A mendicant should never let three occasions for shaving pass without shaving within a year.6 12. Immediately after shaving, an ascetic should bathe with water and earth, control his breath three times, and sprinkle himself with water as he recites the mantras addressed to Varuna [see Ch. 6.47 n. 25].

shaving should be done on the solar day that contains the passage from the full moon to the first day of the dark half-month.

3. Although the neck is not specified in this text, it appears to be implied; see Ch. 9.64.

4. These three are the topknot, the armpits, and the pubic region.

5. The author is here attempting to show that there is no contradiction between Jamadagni, who prescribes three Prājāpatya penances, and Devala and Galava, who prescribe just one. If all three places are shaved at the same time, then the penance is tripled.

6. The point of this rule is somewhat unclear. Vasudevāśrama (see Ypra 61.99) interprets this passage as follows. If a mendicant observes a two-month rain residence, then he should shave at the beginning and end of that period, that is, between the juncture of each season. However, if he keeps a rain residence of four months, then he does not shave during the juncture that falls within that period, because ascetics are forbidden to shave during their rain residence. Instead, he should shave at the third juncture falling at the conclusion of that period.

8. Rules on Insignia and Related Penances 13. A mendicant becomes impure by the water running down from his loincloth. So, after bathing, he should come out of the water and wash his loins with water and the remainder of the earth.

14. If he voids urine or excrement, he should, when he bathes, carry out twice as much of everything normally prescribed; if he remains without bathing for one and a half hours and eats or drinks during that time, he should carry out six times as much of everything normally prescribed.

15. When a person has taken the staff and the like, he should discard them only if they are damaged [see Ch. 3.62 n, 28). He should throw damaged ones in water, saying, "Go to the ocean, svāhā!" 16. After throwing away an article, he should take a new one reciting the Gayatri verse or the syllable OM. He should take a sacrificial string with the mantra "That health and well-being we choose" [TS 2.6.10.2] and the water pot with the mantra "Waters, you bring delight" (see Ch. 6.23 n. 12).

17. An ascetic should place the water pot filled with water and hanging from a sling at a spot at least an arrow's length above the ground; otherwise, he will become defiled.

18. An ascetic is not defiled if he walks a distance of three bow shots without his triple staff in the wilderness, but within a village he is defiled if he goes without it even from one house to another.

19. The same author also states: If an ascetic discards the triple staff and the like that he has taken before they are damaged, he should fast for one night and control his breath one hundred times.

20. Gālava: When someone has a water strainer but performs the rites of sipping water, offering libations, and worship without using it, all his rites will bear no fruit. A penance is enjoined on him in the verse "After controlling his breath three hundred times, he should silently recite the triple prayer [see Ch. 5.82] three hundred times." If he drinks water without using the water strainer, he should control his breath ten times.

21. Atri: If he drinks water that is contaminated--with a bad odor, color, or taste, turbid, or containing hair-without filtering it with a water strainer, he should control his breath ten times.

143 22. In a verse I have already cited [Ch. 6.44], the same author makes an exception in this regard: Water that has been drawn out, water that flows, and water in an unsullied lake such water is pure, the Vedas declare, and should not be filtered with a cloth strainer.

144 23. Gālava: Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism He should recite the syllable OM both when he takes a water strainer and when he ties it to the staff. He should not separate the water strainer from the staff. Should he do so through negligence, he should sip water, control his breath three times, and sip water again. He should not be without his triple staff when he bathes or eats. Should he be without it through negligence, he should sip water, control his breath three times, and sip water again. He should lay down the triple staff with its top toward the east or the north while reciting the mantra "You are the abode of Visnu" [TS 1.1.12.1). If it falls down, he should silently recite the mantra "Rise up, O Brahmanaspati" (RV 1.40.1). If he lets his triple staff come into contact with other staffs, he should wash it with the mantra "You are purified by the mind of Visnu" [MS 4.1.5] and control his breath three times [see Ch. 3.69 n. 30]. If he does so accidentally, he should wash it while reciting OM and further recite OM ten times.

24. Garga: If he lets his staff come into contact with something impure, he should silently recite the mantra "Lord of the forest, be strong in limb" [TS 4.6.6.5]. He should then wash it with the mantra "You are purified by the mind of Visnu" [MS 4.1.5) and control his breath three times. If he does so accidentally, he should wash it while reciting OM and recite OM ten times. 25. Gālava: If the water pot, water strainer, or bowl comes into contact with something impure, the rule is that it should be discarded immediately. 26. Atri: He should not let his bowl come into contact with anything greasy. If he does so accidentally, he becomes impure.

27. The same author states: If someone discards a bowl, a triple staff, or a similar article when it is not damaged or defiled, he should fast for a day and a night and recite the Gayatri verse one hundred and eight times. If, on the other hand, he continues to carry a bowl after it is damaged, he should fast for three days. 28. Jamadagni: He should perform a hundred when he breaches a rule of purity, as well as when he breaks his bowl.8 If his bowl breaks when it is being carried by some other person, however, he should fast for three days.

29. Further on the same author states: 7. It is a general rule that, when he is not using it, an ascetic should always tie his water strainer to the top of his staff.

8. The text is elliptical and does not specify the hundred acts that constitute the penance. In similar contexts, other sources prescribe the control of breathing or the recitation of the Gayatri verse or the syllable OM.

8. Rules on Insignia and Related Penances An ascetic should discard a bowl if it comes into contact with pus, blood, flesh, urine, excrement, semen, tears, or phlegm.

30. If, while carrying a bowl, he comes into contact with a dog, crow, rat, bull, camel, jackal, monkey, or outcaste, or with a man fallen from his caste, he should discard that bowl.

31. A mendicant should discard a staff that has come into contact with marrow, urine, excrement, semen, serum, or blood. When it comes into contact with other types of impure substances, it ought to be purified. 32. Within a village he should not go even from one house to another without his staff. Should he do so, he ought to control his breath several times, as also when he travels in that manner beyond the permitted distance in a forest.

33. If, without a staff, he visits a house or travels beyond three bow shots in a forest, he should control his breath three times for each offense after he returns to his place of residence.

34. He should never be separated from his staff, seat, bowl, and the like. He commits a sin when he separates himself from them, and a penance is enjoined on him.

35-36. When he is separated from them, the scriptures prescribe that he control his breath-one hundred times for the staff, fifty times for the water pot, sixteen times for the bowl, eight times for the water strainer, six times for the sling, and four times for the seat. These are the means of his purification.

37. Satyakāma and Jābāla: Next, we will explain the penances for mendicants. If someone travels beyond a couple of miles leaving behind his bowl, he is required to undergo a penance. He should control his breath thirty times and silently recite the triple prayer three hundred times. If someone crosses a river that flows into the ocean leaving behind his triple staff, bowl, or seat, he should fast for three days and control his breath one hundred times.

38. Further on the same authors state: If a woman or a Śūdra passes between him and his staff, he should control his breath three times. If a donkey or a camel passes between, he should control his breath six times. If a dog, a pig, or an outcaste passes between, he should control his breath twelve times. When he violates a prescribed rule, he should control his breath twelve times.

39. Dakṣa: After leaving behind his triple staff" or his bowl, an ascetic should fast for a whole day. Thereafter, he should take the triple staff with the appropriate mantra but discard the begging bowl.

145 9. In these texts the plural "dandah" is frequently used as a synonym of the triple staff (tridandah), especially due to the exigencies of meter. I have regularly 146 40. Atri: Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism If someone at any time throws his triple staff or his bowl on the ground, he should control his breath sixteen, twelve, eight, or six times.10 41. Devala: Tell us, O great sage, what someone should do to purify a staff and similar articles when they are spoilt by excrement, fire, and the like.

42. He should carefully wash the triple staff with earth and water twelve times. Then he should silently recite the Purusa hymn [RV 10.190] and again wash it with water. With regard to other articles so defiled, O best of kings, the rule is that they are to be thrown away at once.

43. One should throw away a bowl, a water strainer, or a similar article that has come into contact with semen, leavings of food, tears, excrement, urine, phlegm, a Sudra, cattle, or fire, as well as when they are touched by a thief or similar person.

44. If an ascetic accepts a staff or a similar article from a person belonging to the four classes beginning with a Sudra, he should control his breath. one hundred, fifty, twenty-five, or ten times, respectively.12 45. Atri: If he accepts an article such as sandals, umbrella, garment, or begging bowl from a Sūdra, he should control his breath one hundred times; from a Vaisya, fifty times; from a Ksatriya, twenty-five times; and from a debased Brahmin, ten times.

46. Jābāli the Elder: If a mendicant leaves behind his triple staff and water strainer in some house, he should silently recite the Purusa hymn [RV 10.190] and control his breath ten times.

47. Devala: A householder who eats what others have cooked and a mendicant who neglects having a bowl are reborn in animal wombs for ten thousand years.

translated such plurals as "triple staff" so as not to create a confusion for the reader of the translation.

10. It is unclear whether the numbers refer to general alternatives of the penance or, what I believe is more likely, to specific penances for placing directly on the ground the different articles: sixteen for the staff, twelve for the bowl, and so forth. See the similar gradation at Ch. 8.35-36.

11. The term "kravyada" can refer to any animal or bird that eats carrion or raw flesh, as well as to fire, especially the cremation fire that "eats" the flesh of the deceased. Articles are to be discarded when they are damaged or burnt (see Ch. 7.100).

12. The meaning is that he should control his breath one hundred times if he accepts from a Śūdra, fifty times if he accepts from a Vaisya, and so forth (see verse 45). I have taken "pañca" (lit., "five") to be a shorthand for "pañcavimsati" ("twentyfive") required by the exigencies of the meter.

8. Rules on Insignia and Related Penances 48. When a bowl is unavailable, an ascetic is required to use a vessel made of leaves. He may use such a vessel until he gets a regular bowl.

49. Kapila: A frail ascetic may carry the following: needle, nail clippers, water strainer, bowl, undergarment, and outergarment.

50. Atri: If he discards his sacrificial string, he should perform six Krechra penances [see Ch. 4.2 n. 1] while reciting the Gayatri verse. Then he should undergo again the rite of investiture with a sacrificial string.

51. Jābāli the Elder: If a mendicant devoted to meditation lives without a sacrificial string, then all his activities will bear no fruit. A penance is prescribed for such a man.

52. He should perform six Prajapatya penances while reciting the Gayatrī verse. Then he should undergo vedic initiation again and wear a sacrificial string.

53. Without delay, then, he should take a triple staff. He will thus not end up in hell but attain a happy state after death.

147 54. This same penance applies also to those who have taken to the form of ascetic life that requires the abandonment of the sacrificial string. Hārīta: I will tell you the penance that will erase the sin committed when someone performs rites such as eating without wearing a sacrificial string.

55. He becomes purified by duly controlling his breath five hundred times for each day that he had performed the rites of eating and the like in that manner.

56. When a man devotes himself in this world to the continuous practice of yoga, even the grievous sins he may have committed are erased. Therefore, a man should devote himself to yoga and always meditate at the conclusion of rites.

57. The same author states: If a sterling Brahmin inadvertently voids urine or excrement without wearing a sacrificial string, he should control his breath six times.

58. He should at all times wear the string in the sacrificial position, except when he answers a call of nature. When answering a call of nature he should let the string hang from his neck and throw it on his back. 13 13. In its normal position the string (which is a loop) is worn on the left shoulder, extending across the chest and resting on the right hip. This is the position for all ritual activities, except ancestral rites, when the string is worn on the right shoulder and rests on the left hip. The string is left hanging from the neck like a garland 148 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 59. Next, I will discuss the garment. In this connection, Gautama remarks: He should wear a garment to cover his loins. According to some, he should use discarded clothes after washing them. [GDh 3.18-19] 60. Bṛhaspati: He should wear an old garment to cover his loins. According to some, should use old clothes that have been thrown outside by others. 61. Hārīta: he He should take a loincloth, a ragged shawl as protection against the cold, and a pair of sandals. Let him not take possession of anything else. 62. Jābāli: Let him wear a cotton garment, a religious habit that is not made with tree bark. Without wearing such a garment, he is not purified when he sips water or when he performs the twilight worship. He should wear only an ocher-colored cotton garment, as well as a ragged shawl.

63. Śankha and Likhita: He should carry in his hand a triple staff tied with a water strainer. He should wear a garment made of Kusa grass, ragged cloth, or tree bark, and have a change of clothes. 14 Some permit also a ragged shawl against the cold.

64. Even though the term ocher is used without further specification, nevertheless one should color the garments with the red chalk known as Gairikā. Jābāli the Elder, for instance, points this out when he prohibits householders from wearing the insignia of the ascetic state: He should not wear a garment dyed ocher, or carry a sling or a tripod: this is the characteristic behavior of a graduate.15 65. Dattatreya: The scriptures prescribe a garment colored with red chalk for people in the order of life devoted to liberation. They should, however, wear a white sacrificial string made of nine strands.

(technically called nivita) when one goes to the toilet. Various strategies are used to prevent the string from contamination. In modern India Brahmins usually wrap the string around the right ear.

14. The meaning of the term "viparidhana" (or of the alternate reading "viparidhavana") is unclear. Because the verb is regularly used with reference to changing one's clothes (see Ch. 6.30, 32), I have taken the noun to mean a spare set of clothes.

15. A graduate is a person who has concluded his period of vedic study (see Ch. 2.36 n. 15). Quite frequently, the legal literature uses the expression with reference to all householders, who by definition have concluded their vedic studentship. Regarding the identity of the tripod and its distinction from the triple staff, see Olivelle 1986, 42-52.8. Rules on Insignia and Related Penances 149 66. An ascetic should not become attached even to those articles that he is required to possess. Devala, accordingly, states: Looking upon earth and gold with equal eyes and totally impartial, let him not develop an attachment even to the articles he possesses.

67. Manu: He should be free from attachment to the articles he possesses. 68. Vasistha: Hut, water, clothes, tripod, 16 house, seat, food--a man who is not attached to any of these truly knows the path to liberation.17 [VaDh 10.23] 69. That ends the eighth chapter, entitled "Rules on Insignia and Related Penances," of the Collection of Ascetic Laws.

16. The meaning of "tripuskara" is unclear. The term refers to a famous pilgrimage center with three holy lakes, and Būhler translated it as "the three Pushkaras (holy tanks)." This meaning does not fit the context, which includes a variety of items associated with the life of an ascetic. I have taken the term as referring to the tripod from which hangs the ascetic's water pot. This meaning is very uncertain, but the term puskara can refer to an arrow, and possibly to any shaft or stick. The association of the water pot with a holy lake, moreover, makes this connection plausible.

17. The Sanskrit expression here is "mokṣavit"-literally "one who knows liberation" but the term "mokṣa" in ascetic literature frequently is a synonym of the renunciatory state (see Ch. 7.2 n. 1) CHAPTER NINE Wandering and Rain Residence 1. I will explain next the wandering and residence of ascetics. On this point, Gautama remarks: He should be celibate and keep a fixed residence during the rains. (GDh 3.11-12] 2. Medhātithi: He is seen in one place in the morning, at another place at noon, and at yet another at sunset; like the sun, he should remain without a home and free from attachment.

3. He should spend the night in one place, either in a temple or in a fire stall, except when he is afraid for his life or when there is a great danger.

4. He should spend the four months of the rainy season outside a village. The two reasons given above remain valid here also for entering a village.

5. From these passages we gather that an ascetic should reside in one place only during the rainy season and not at other times. Manu makes a small concession here: During the eight hot and cold months he should on the whole roam around. Out of compassion for all living beings, he should reside in one place during the rains.

6. Kratu spells out the concession hinted at here by the words "on the whole": Residing in one place only during the rains, he should wander along the path pointed out by the sun, spending one day in a village, three days in a town, and five or seven days in a city.

7-8. Likhita: Having surrendered himself to the highest Brahman, he should travel to sacred bathing places and temples, as he, full of compassion, continues to perform rites according to his ability and to be totally devoted to the prac- 150 9. Wandering and Rain Residence tice of yoga and to silent prayer. To purify himself, moreover, he should perform Krechra penances, lunar fasts [see Ch.5.11 n.5), and similar austerities 9. Unless he is blind, sick, or lame, he should not spend six nights in any one place. If his mind is totally focused on his duties, however, and if he comes from a different region, he may optionally reside in one place all the time.

10. It is certain that all ascetics should maintain a fixed residence in one place during the four months beginning with Śrāvana [July-August].

11. Devala: He should not reside for long in one place outside of the rainy season. The rainy season is the four months beginning with Sravana [July-August]. He should not travel during that period.

12. Gālava: During the rains he should live in one place, either in an abandoned house or at the foot of a tree.

13. Viśvāmitra: He may, indeed, live in one place even outside of the rainy season.

14. Manu the Elder states: If a man is eminent in virtue, however, he may reside in one place until death. Otherwise, he should cultivate the habit of wandering. This is the opinion of the venerable teachers.

15. Yama comments on the place and the manner of such residence: He should spend a single night in a village and five nights in a city. During the four months of the rainy season, however, a sage should reside in one place.

16. On land and in water living creatures abound; the sky is garlanded with living creatures. So during the rains, when the world is packed with living beings, let him reside in one place.

17. His mind serene and controlled, let him roam the earth like a worm along the path pointed out by the sun, without making any provision for the next day.

18. During the night, and at dawn, noon, and dusk, he should not move to a different place except to void urine or excrement or when he fears for his life.

19. Totally unfettered, let him always wander alone, without a companion; for when a man wanders alone his path becomes smooth, but it thwarts him when he does not.

20. He should place his foot on the ground after determining its purity by inspection. He should drink water that has been purified with a cloth 151 152 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism strainer. He should speak truthful words, and he should work for the welfare of all creatures.

21. A mendicant should wear a single garment, eat once a day, use a single bowl, and go around alone to beg in a village--that is the ancient vow of the seers.

22. He should always sleep on the ground and never have a fixed residence. He should shave his head and always live in the wilderness. And he should turn his mind continuously to mediation.

23. A place rich in almsfood, the king, relatives, sons, friends and the like, his wife, and gossip about benefactors-let him not even think about these.

24. A sage, if he is serious about attaining liberation, should not pay respects to any of his friends or tell them "Come! Go! Stay! Welcome!" 25. Every day one should pay obeisance to those ascetics who are senior in their vows and who carry out their duties faithfully, as if they were the images of Visnu.

26. An ascetic should pay obeisance only to a renouncer who was ordained before him and who is his equal in virtue, and to no one else.

27. An ascetic should pay homage only to the gods and to aged ascetics who are faithful to their duties; he should never pay respects to a member of any other order of life, however eminent he may be.

28. Let him not fill himself up morning and evening, or become overly fond of food. Nor should he, out of lust, ever become attached to sense objects.

29. He may ask the way and ask for almsfood. He is allowed to speak only on those two occasions; every other type of speech is forbidden.

30. Atri: Keeping his virtues hidden and living a life of obscurity, let the wise man, although not a fool, behave like a fool without corrupting the path of virtue.

31. Kapila: Let him somehow keep a fixed residence, just like the old and the sick. 32. Brhaspati: Except in a time of emergency, an ascetic should never accept provisions for a journey. In an emergency he may accept cooked food so long as it is eaten that very day.

1. The meaning is that junior ascetics should pay their respects to ascetics who are more senior. "Vows" here probably refers to their ascetic ordination. Seniority within the ascetic community is measured according to not the age but the time when each member was ritually admitted into the ascetic order.

9. Wandering and Rain Residence 153 33. Jamadagni: A man is not defiled by having something in his hands when he voids urine or excrement in the wilderness, in a deserted region, or on a road infested with robbers or tigers.

34. Placing that item on the ground, he should purify himself according to the rules, and then, taking it in his lap, he becomes pure by sipping water. 35. Gālava: If he travels beyond nine miles, he should control his breath twelve times.

Rain Residence 36. Next, I will discuss the four-month period of the rainy season. One begins this period on the full-moon day of Aṣadha [June-July] and concludes it on the full moon of Kārttika [October-November]; or one begins it on the full moon of Śrāvana [July-August] and concludes it on the full moon of Margaśīrṣa [November-December]. Others, however, maintain that the vow concludes after two months, because the statement "He should keep a fixed residence during the rains" [Ch. 9.1] prescribes one season.2 37. Jābāli: During the eight hot and cold months he should on the whole roam around. Out of compassion for all living beings, he should reside in one place during the rains.

38. With faith and devotion, he should reside in a village during the four months of the rains, for if he does not transgress this rule of residence, he will attain the eternal state.

39. When it rains even out of season, he should not travel beyond a couple of miles from the village limits as long as the ground remains wet.

40. Medhātithi: He should collect dry and pleasant earth of high quality on the twelfth day of the bright half during lunar month of May-June or June-August, without causing harm to any creature.3 2. The argument here is that the expressions "rains" generally refers to a particular season of the calendar year. A season, however, consists of only two months. Therefore, the vow of keeping a fixed residence should apply only to the two months of the rainy season.

3. Even though the terms "suci" and "sukra" have somewhat indeterminate meanings, within the context of the four-month rain residence they probably indicate the months of Jyestha and Aṣadha. The earth collected is used much like soap for bathing and cleaning oneself after toilet. During the dry months such earth could be collected at any time, but during the rains there is a danger of killing worms and insects. Therefore, all the earth an ascetic would require for the four months had to be 154 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 41. When it rains even out of season, a mendicant who is faithful to his duties should refrain from traveling as long as the ground remains wet. He should keep a fixed residence during the four months from Aṣādha [June- July] until the beginning of Kārttika [October-November].

42. Atri: I will declare the rules regarding the four-month residence of self-controlled ascetics, by following which a man is always sure to attain liberation.

43-44. On any auspicious day from the beginning of Jyestha [May-June] until the full moon of Aṣadha [June-July], or on the day that he makes the ritual declaration of intent, an ascetic should proceed to a public field that is dry, pleasant, sandy, and without gravel, stones, creepers, plants, clods, and the like.

45. Let him call to mind Visnu in the form of a boar as he supported the earth and the purifying earth as she was born by Vasudeva abiding in the heart of every being.

46. "The Self-existent One abides within you, O goddess, through the holy syllable OM, for you have been created by the God of gods as the means of purification.

47. "The holy syllable OM, O goddess, likewise abides within you, the earth." Having thus made the divinities abide in the earth with the mantras containing the syllable OM, he should then recite: 48. "I bear the earth on my head, O goddess, you who have been traversed by the horse, the chariot, and Visṇu. Protect me at every step. You are the earth, the cow, the sustainer, the support of the world, you who were raised up by the black boar with a hundred hands. Destroy my sins, O earth, destroy whatever evil I have done. When you have destroyed my sins, I will live a hundred years. Make me prosperous, O earth, for you are the foundation of all things. She rules over all creatures, she is marked by smell, she is difficult to assail, she is eternally prosperous, she abounds in cow dung-I invoke that goddess of prosperity.S collected prior to the rains. This collection became highly ritualized within Brahmanical and other forms of Indian asceticism, as did the four months of enforced residence.

4. Before performing any ritual a person is required to declare formally and publicly his intention to perform that ritual. This declaration is technically called sam kalpa. The declaration is generally done the day prior to the rite-in the present case, the day before the full moon of June-July.

5. The critical edition contains only the initial words of these mantras. They are found in the MNU 89-111. The statement that the earth is marked by smell probably refers to the cosmological view that assigns a particular quality to each of the five elements, earth being assigned the quality of smell. Earth abounding in cow dung is considered doubly pure and purifying.

9. Wandering and Rain Residence 49. "Viṣṇu, assuming a fierce form, once raised you up, O goddess. May that Kesava, who gives support to you, the supporter of all, join you in protecting me.

50. "You, O goddess earth, are known as the support, the governess, the purifier, and the mother of all creatures, and you grant safety to all.

51. "May the earth along with Visnu protect me from all creatures." With his self composed, let him thus pray to the earth, the supporter of the world, and then continue: 52. "O earth, you have been given by Brahma at the request of Kasyapa. Remove, O earth, whatever evil I may have done." 53. He should take that auspicious earth, reciting the two mantras beginning with "Visnu traversed this..." [RV 1.22.17-18]. Then, seated facing the east on Darbha grass and carrying blades of Darbha in his hands, he should undertake the vow of the four-month rain residence: 54. "Madhava, the Lord of the universe, together with his wife Laksmi, spends these four months sleeping on the coils of the serpent Seṣa for the welfare of all creatures.

55. "Until the eternal Lord awakens from his sleep, I too will reside in one place for the welfare of all creatures." 56-57. Then he should recite silently the verse "The sky is firm, the earth is firm..." [RV 10.173.4] and touch the earth. A mendicant should follow the very same procedure when he performs the vow either on the twelfth day of the bright half or on the full-moon day of Aṣāḍha [June-July] or, if that full moon is cut short, on the day of the Uttara Aṣadha constellation.6 58. Fetching some earth while reciting "Visnu traversed this..." [RV 1.22.17-18], he should bring it back. Then he should worship the holy bathing places with the same mantra.

59. After he has paid obeisance to the older ascetics in the order of their seniority and in the prescribed manner, an ascetic who is junior should offer some earth to an ascetic who is senior to him.

60-61. He should worship one or two balls of earth with the following mantra: "Accept this ball of earth, O mendicant, which is auspicious and removes all sins. May this goddess along with Visnu protect both you 155 6. Earlier (Ch. 9.43-44) the author stated that the vow should be performed in May-June, prior to the start of Aṣāḍha. Here he gives alternative days within the month of Aṣāḍha. The expression "khanda paurnima" ("full moon cut short") in all likelihood is the same as "khanda tithi," that is, a lunar day that is current at sunrise but ends before midday. On such a day one does not start or conclude a vow (Nyayakośa, p. 255). If the full moon of Aṣadha ends before noon, then one commences the rain retreat not on that day but on the lunar day that falls on the constellation called Uttara Aṣādha, which falls approximately between the twenty-first and twenty-fifth days of the lunar month.

156 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism and me." Having thus taken that earth, he should use it in performing rites. such as bathing.

62. He should use the earth that he has collected at this time to perform purificatory rites that require the use of earth during the four rainy months. 63. From the following day, which is the first day of Śrāvaṇa [July- August), he should neither travel nor get himself shaved for four months.? 64. He should get himself shaved on the opening and concluding days of the rain residence. Even at these times he should never shave below the neck, or the topknot, eyelashes, or eyebrows.

65. If he is unable to begin his rain residence on the twelfth day or on the full moon because of some difficulty or because he cannot find a place to stay, he may travel on until the fifth day of the dark fortnight.

66. If an ascetic travels after that time, he ought to perform a penance. A mendicant should perform one Krcchra penance if he travels in disguise. 67. If he travels beyond a couple of miles from the village limits, he should control his breath thirty times and silently recite the triple prayer three hundred times.

68. The above penance applies to a person who returns the same day. In this connection, Jabali the Elder gives the penance for a person who stays away overnight: One should not travel beyond a couple of miles from the village limits. If someone carelessly travels more than a couple of miles, he becomes purified only after he has performed a Prajapatya penance and controlled his breath sixteen times.

69. Vāyu: A Brahmin who has been initiated into yoga should not disrupt his rain residence. If he does so, he is cleansed and regains his purity by performing a hot Krechra penance [see Ch. 10.44 n. 9].

70. When he perceives a bodily danger during an emergency, when a famine strikes, or when there is an upheaval in the kingdom, he should leave that place even during the rains.

71. Even during the rains he should quickly abandon a region that is infested with robbers, afflicted with a famine, or plagued by disease, or that has been overrun by another king.

72. Atri: If someone abandons his residence during the rainy season when there is no crisis, he should silently recite the triple prayer one thousand times and control his breath one hundred times.

7. This verse assumes that the vow of rain residence is performed on the full moon of Śravana (July-August), which is given as an alternate date (Ch. 9.10, 36) 9. Wandering and Rain Residence 73. If someone enters a different place during the rainy season when there is no crisis, he should silently recite the triple prayer one thousand times and control his breath one hundred times.

74. If during the rains someone bypasses many villages that are suitable to reside in, he should perform one Krechra penance for each village he bypasses to free himself from that sin.

75-76. He should consecrate the water with the four mantras beginning with "The waters, the eldest of whom is the ocean..." [RV 7.49.1-4] and the Śiras mantra. The head is shaved on all four sides after moistening it with water. He should consecrate the razor with the mantra "Sharpen us..." [RV 8.4.16]. It is appropriate for an ascetic who is sick or in some danger to perform rites such as shaving at any time until the fifth day of the dark fortnight.

77. On the twelfth day or the full moon in the month of Karttika [October- November] he should get himself shaved and throw the remaining earth into water as he recites the mantra "Go along the wide atmosphere..." [TS 1.1.2.21.8 78. On the next day, that is, on the thirteenth day of the bright fortnight or the first day of the dark fortnight," he should get up and go to any region. he wants while reciting the verse "Three steps Visṇu made..." [RV 1.22.18]. 79. The three verses beginning with "Mighty and invincible is the celestial help of the three gods..." [RV 10.185.1-3], as well as the verse "The ancient paths of yours..." [TS 7.5.24.1]-after he has silently recited these verses, he should go away, walking first toward the east or the north.

80. Gautama: Outside the season he should not spend a second night in a village. [GDh 3.21] 157 81. Maskarin (on GDh 3.21] explains: "When the season is over, he should not spend a second night in a village. The meaning is that he should not spend two days in a single village." 82. Viśvarupa explains:10 "Even though the statement Outside the season... does not specify the season, nevertheless we should take it as referring to the rainy season, according to Sankha's statement: 'A single place of residence is 8. Here the author switches to the conclusion of the rain residence. During the concluding rite the ascetic throws away the earth that he has not used during the rainy season and begins a new chapter in his liturgical calendar.

9. If he concludes his rain residence on the twelfth day, then the following day would be the thirteenth of the bright fortnight, whereas if he concludes it on the full moon, then the following day would be the first of the dark fortnight.

10. Viśvarupa wrote a commentary on the Yajnavalkyasmṛti (YDh), in which I have not been able to trace this citation. There is no mention anywhere else that he wrote a commentary on the GDh.

158 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism not prescribed outside the two months of the rainy season.' The two months of Śrāvana [July-August] and Bhadrapada [August-September] apply to those who are weak. Devala [see Ch. 9.11] prescribes four months: 'He should not stay long in one place outside the rainy season. The four months beginning with Sravana [July-August] constitute the rainy season."" 83. Satyakāma and Jābāla: When a mendicant arrives in a village, a town, or a city during the rainy season, he should remain there permanently. But when the rains are over he should not remain there even a moment longer. If he remains there inadvertently, he should perform a Prajapatya penance.

84. Atri once again states: ... after he has silently recited these verses[see Ch. 9.79], he should go away, walking first toward the east or the north. He should spend only a single night in a village, but on some occasions he may reside there longer as if he were blind, stupid, deaf, mad, and dumb [see Ch. 7.130–36].

85. Should he divulge his name, lineage, and the like; the branch of the Veda he belongs to; the region he comes from; his ancestry, family, learning, and age; and the mode of life, the vows, and the virtues he observes, he will never attain success. Divulging such things, no doubt, causes harm to a pious ascetic.

86. Keeping his virtues hidden and living a life of obscurity, let the wise man, although not a fool, behave like a fool without corrupting the path of virtue.

87. That ends the ninth chapter, entitled "Description of Wandering and Residence," of the Collection of Ascetic Laws.CHAPTER TEN Penances 1. Now I will describe the penances. Vayu writes on this subject: Penances should be performed both for sins committed unintentionally and for sins deliberately committed. Even here others make the following observations 2. Sins, one should know, are of three kinds: sins committed by word, thought, and deed. Spread across day and night, they burn the people here. 3. Neither rites nor life lasts long-this is the highest truth the Veda teaches. So, while one is still alive, one should practice penances without any delay.

4. People begin to take delight in sins when they habitually commit them. Thus these sins increase day by day. It is through penance that a man should purify himself of sins committed both habitually and deliberately. He should continue to purify himself thus until his mind becomes serene. 5. If perchance a yogin inadvertently commits a grievous sin, he should perform just his yogic practice and not undergo any other expiation.

6. The yogic practices of breath control, withdrawal of senses, and meditation destroy sins committed inadvertently better than any other penitential observance.

7. This passage points out that penitential observances have to be performed for sins committed habitually or deliberately, while yogic practice is prescribed for sins committed inadvertently. This point is made also by Hārīta: When a man devotes himself in this world to the continuous practice of yoga, even the grievous sins he may have committed are erased.

8. Atri: If an ascetic is unable to perform penances such as Kṛcchra, lunar fast, Parāka, and Santapana [see Ch. 5.11 n. 5], he should control his breath.

9. A sin committed by men that takes a day's fast to erase is undoubtedly erased by silently reciting the triple prayer [see Ch. 5.82] one thousand times.

159 160 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 10. A sin that a twice-born man destroys by reciting the triple prayer one thousand times is completely destroyed by controlling the breath just one hundred times.

11. A sin that twice-born men destroy by controlling the breath one thousand times is completely destroyed at once by meditating on Visnu.

12. Control of breathing, silent prayer, meditation-for a mendicant there is no means of purification other than these. A mendicant, therefore, should perform these alone to purify himself.

13. By these three means a mendicant, if he controls his breath one hundred times every day, frees himself even from the guilt of killing his father and mother.

14. Jamadagni: When the control of breathing, mediation, and silent prayer are performed continuously, they burn up all sins, as fire burns a kindling stick.

15. Vyāsa: A man purifies himself of all the minor sins, as well as of the most grievous ones, when he meditates on Brahman during one quarter of the night.

16. Gālava: The sight of the Lord is the expiation for all sins." 17. Vayu: Yoga takes root in a vigilant man; indeed, yoga is thought to be the best. There is nothing more beneficial to men than yoga.

18. It is the greatest of all purifiers, the best of all cleansers. Therefore, the wise recommend it for those who are able to undertake it.

19. Jamadagni: Alternatively, one should carry out what one's teacher orders without hesitation; in all matters, whether it is assessing punishments or conferring favors, the teacher is the authority.

20. Vayu: When a man commits a transgression in thought, word, or deed, he should carry out the collective decision of the assembled judges.2 1. The sight of the Lord may refer to either the inner contemplation of the Lord in meditation, as suggested by the preceding statements, or the sight (darsana) of the Lord that one receives in a temple.

2. I have taken the term "sabhya" in its more technical sense as people sitting in a formal council. It may also be taken to mean any cultured and educated person, in which case the decision regarding the punishment would be made in a less formal way.

10. Penances 161 21. Atri: Eating little, austerity, silence, and bathing at dawn, noon, and dusk are likewise prescribed specifically for a mendicant who has committed a minor sin.

22. After controlling his breath one thousand times, he should silently recite the syllable OM ten thousand times and then the triple prayer twentyfive thousand times in the prescribed manner. A mendicant is purified by performing this vow in the wilderness.

23. Next I will describe the penance for neglecting the twilight worship. Devala comments in this connection: If, through carelessness, a person who is not sick fails to perform his twilight worship, he is sure to be purified by silently reciting the triple prayer one thousand times.

24. Garga: A mendicant who neglects to perform his twilight worship is required to do a penance. He should silently recite the triple prayer one thousand times and control his breath one hundred times.

25. Gālava: He should worship the sun when it is half risen. If he lets that time lapse, he should control his breath twelve times.

26. Next, the penances relating to begging. Devala writes in this regard: After announcing himself,3 he should not remain long. If he remains a long time, he should control his breath sixteen times. After announcing himself, he should not pay reverence to gods, elders, and the like. If he does so out of ignorance, he should control his breath sixteen times. After announcing himself, he should not neglect to accept the almsfood. If he neglects, he should control his breath thirty times. After announcing himself, he should not eat a full meal from a single house. If he eats, he should perform a Prajapatya penance.

27. Bharadvāja: He should avoid conversations. If he does so inadvertently, he should control his breath three times. After taking the bowl in his left hand and the triple staff in his right, he should never change the hand in which each is carried. If he changes inadvertently, he should control his breath three 3. When a mendicant arrives at a house, he announces his presence by saying "Lady, give almsfood"; see Ch. 6.174, 183-85. These penances relate to breaking the rules of etiquette accompanying such a request.

162 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism times. He should not let the bowl he carries in his left hand come into contact with the triple staff in his right hand. If he allows them to come into contact, he should control his breath six times. After announcing himself and entering a house, he should not sit down. If he sits anywhere, he should control his breath twelve times. If, through carelessness, a mendicant accepts almsfood at the invitation of a Sudra or a menstruating woman, he should control his breath sixteen times. He should not beg for or accept almsfood after leaving the triple staff outside a house. If he accepts, he should control his breath sixteen times. He should not let the triple staff out of his hand when begging for or accepting almsfood. If he does so inadvertently, he should control his breath one hundred times.

28-31. Devala and Kasyapa: Dogs, donkeys, camels, mice, cats, vultures, monkeys, pigs, blackened wood, a funeral pyre,4 human bones, village fowl, jackals, ungrateful people, Śūdras, drunkards, people who have discarded the sacrificial string, naked people, twice-born men who have entered heretical sects, traitors, people who speak ill of gods or Brahmins, arsonists, mercenary teachers of the law,6 dirt piles, hermaphrodites, and Brahmins who act as temple priests?-if an ascetic touches any of these, he should place his begging bowl on a pure spot and go to an auspicious place of water [see Ch.

4.29 n. 28].

32. After purifying himself according to the rules, the ascetic should wash with earth and water the part of the body that was defiled, using twelve applications of earth.

33. Then he should wash all that with water and take a bath. Becoming pure again after sipping some water, he should eat and then control his breath six times.

34. After sprinkling himself with water repeatedly while reciting the three mantras beginning "Waters, you bring delight" [RV 10.9.1-31, he should per- 4. The reading of the edition is uncertain and possibly corrupt. I have taken "agnicayana" to refer to a funeral pyre, which is the only plausible meaning in the context of human bones, even though that meaning is not standard.

5. This may include those ascetics of the Advaita tradition who discard their sacrificial strings upon becoming renouncers, some of whom also went naked; Olivelle 1986-87.

6. The term "dharmavikrayin" literally mean "a seller of dharma." I have taken it to refer to Brahmins who teach the Vedas in return for monetary compensation. Teachers traditionally taught at no cost to students, although the students were expected to render services to the teacher and to give him a gift at the conclusion of their period of study.

7. Although the term "devalaka" can refer to any priest who performs temple services, it is specially applied in legal literature to Brahmins who earn their living by such services. One source defines such a person thus: "A Brahmin who devotes himself to idol worship for three years to make a living is called a devalaka. He is forbidden from taking part in offerings to the gods or ancestors." See Ypra 38.22-23.

10. Penances form the Aghamarṣaṇa [see Ch. 6.34 n. 16] while standing in the water and bathe once again.

35. He should take the begging bowl after sprinkling it with water while reciting the triple prayer and again immerse it in water together with his hand.8 36. In this manner a mendicant's almsfood is purified when it comes into contact with the things listed above. A begging bowl should be purified only when it comes into contact with something else, and not otherwise. 37. If someone continues to use a begging bowl after it has come into contact with a Sudra, dog, crow, and the like, he should observe a lunar fast. 38. Jamadagni: If an ascetic comes into contact with a dog, a crow, a pig, a prostitute, excrement, a donkey, or a camel, he is purified by immersing himself in water together with his almsfood and reciting silently the Aghamarṣaṇa hymn.

39. Jābāli the Elder: If a renouncer touches a dog or an impure thing while he is on his begging round, after collecting the almsfood he should bathe and control his breath six times.

40. He should purify the almsfood by reciting the Gayatri verse and the syllable OM; it is made pure by sprinkling it with water while reciting the mantra sacred to Varuna.

41. Garga: If someone accepts almsfood after the begging bowl has fallen down, he should control his breath thirty times.

42. Gālava: One should avoid a house in which fish or meat is cooked. If someone accepts almsfood at such a house, he should control his breath twelve times. 43. Devala: If someone begs both within a village and outside it and accepts almsfood from both locations, he should perform the Santapana observance [see Ch.

5.11 n. 5].

44. Jamadagni: If, after entering one village to beg and failing to obtain any almsfood there, he begs in a second village, he should perform the hot penance." 163 8. The syntax of sakare is unclear, and my translation, "together with his hand," is tentative. If one separates the words (sa kare) and takes kara to mean sunlight, one could arrive at ". . . immerse it in water, and (leave it) in the sun." 9. The "hot penance" (taptakṛechra) consists of consuming nothing but hot milk, hot ghee, and hot water and inhaling hot air during an entire day. According to some, each substance is consumed for three days (see MDh 11.214; VaDh 21.21; BDh 164 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 45. If, after almsfood has been placed in the bowl, an ascetic eats a full meal from a single house, he should control his breath one hundred times to purify himself.

46. If someone who eats food begged in the manner of a bee1" fails to make the customary oblations of food to the gods," he is sure to be purified only by performing a Prajapatya penance.

47. If someone who eats food begged in the manner of a bee offers the oblations of food to the gods and then does not eat the food, he becomes pure only after three nights.

48. Gālava: If an ascetic eats on the same day both the food given by some individual and the food he has obtained by begging, he should silently recite the Gayatri verse ten thousand times.

49. Devala: If, after setting aside the oblation to the gods in the begging bowl, an ascetic fails to recite the appropriate mantra, he becomes purified by silently reciting the triple prayer one thousand times.

50. When a mendicant comes into contact with a menstruating woman, a corpse, an outcaste, a thief, a naked person, an ascetic who carries a skull as a begging bowl,12 a person who has fallen from his caste, or a treacherous person, he should discard his almsfood.

51. If an ascetic eats just once the food of a man fallen from his caste, he should perform a penance. He is sure to be purified by performing the Vajra penance three times.

52. One should cook a handful of barley in cow's urine and eat it on the day of the new moon. That is the great Vajra penance. 13 53. Alternatively, one may perform the Prajapatya penance for eating the food of a fallen man. If one eats inadvertently from such a man just once, he is purified by a Prajapatya penance.

54. He should, moreover, control his breath one hundred times and perform the quarter Krechra penance (see Ch. 4.2 n.1]. Or he may drink for three 2.2.37), the total penance thus lasting twelve days. For variants, see ViDh 46.11; YDh 3.317.

10. For the various ways in which almsfood can be obtained, see Ch. 6.80-86. 11. For a description of these oblations, see Ch. 6.223-32.

12. The term may more specifically refer to a Kāpālika ascetic of the Saivite tradition, and the adjective "naked" may indeed be an attribute qualifying such an ascetic.

13. A description somewhat different from this is provided in a text ascribed to Atri and cited by Kane (IV, 149), which says that the penance consists of eating barley fried in ghee and mixed with cow's urine.

10. Penances nights a decoction made by boiling the Sankhapuspa plant14 and mixing it with milk.

55. Hārīta: I will teach you how to purify yourself after eating food when a doubt or a confusion arises regarding its purity. Listen as I explain.

56. One should drink a decoction made with the Brahmasuvarcala plant15 without adding salt or lime. Or else he should drink a decoction made with the Sankhapuspa plant and mixed with milk.

57. Or he should drink a decoction made by boiling the leaves of Palāśa and Bilva, Kusa grass, lotus leaves, and Udumbara fruits. 16 He will then be purified in three nights.

58. Or he could purify himself after eating a forbidden food by drinking the five products17 of a tawny cow according to the rules.

59-60. Atri: A full meal given by a single person, honey, meat, food contaminated by feces and the like, food obtained by paying respects, food offered to the gods, and salt given separately [see Ch. 6.148 n. 46]-if an ascetic eats any one of these, he should perform a Prajapatya penance. If he eats food containing honey or meat, however, he should perform a Parāka penance [see Ch. 5.11 n. 5] and silently recite the triple prayer one hundred thousand times. If he chooses silent prayer as a penance, he should recite it silently for a year.

61. If, in an emergency, someone consumes pieces of living creatures contained in his water or eats honey or meat, he should silently recite the triple prayer one thousand times and control his breath one hundred times. 62. Jābāli the Elder: If, out of compassion, someone gives or accepts what has not been given. to him, he should perform the great Saumya penance18 or else a Prajapatya penance.

63. If a mendicant eats a full meal from a single person out of either kindness or greed, he is purified by performing a Prājāpatya penance and by controlling his breath one hundred times.

14. The botanical name for this plant is Andropogon aciculatus.

165 15. The botanical name for this plant is Heliantus or Clerodendron siphonanthus.

= 16. The botanical names are: Palaśa Butea frondosa; Bilva = Aegle marmelos (Indian Bel); Kuśa Poa cynosuroides; Udumbara Ficus glomerata.

17. Milk, buttermilk, ghee, urine, and feces.

= 18. Sources contain different descriptions of this penance. According to the YDh (3.321), it lasts six days. During each of the first five days the penitent subsists on oil-cake, scum from boiled rice, butter milk, water, and barley, respectively. On the last day he observes a total fast. See Kane, IV, 152.

166 64. Devala: Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism If worms come out of a wound on his body or if he eats honey or meat, he should fast for three days and control his breath one hundred times.

65. Gālava: If someone eats honey or meat, he should perform a Parāka penance. If he chews betel, he should fast for a day and a night. If he does so deliberately, he should perform a Prājāpatya penance.

66. Jamadagni: A full meal given by a single person, honey, meat, food at a funerary offering for a newly deceased person, food at a house where a birth has taken place, and salt given separately-these foods are forbidden to ascetics. To purify oneself after violating the ban on each of these items, one should perform a Prajapatya penance.

67. Kratu: If an ascetic eats food that has been contaminated by dogs, mice, cats, crows, hair, worms, bones, or clothes, he is purified by eating the five products of a cow.

68. Bharadvāja observes in the passage beginning with: If, while he is eating, he finds some food contaminated with tiny bits of hair or insects. . . . [see Ch. 6.206] 69. Devala: If it ever happens that while someone is eating he finds that he has become impure by eating a piece of meat, 19 he should first throw away that food and then take a bath. Afterward, he should silently recite the triple prayer one thousand times and control his breath one hundred times.

70. Jamadagni: If it ever happens that a Brahmin has a bowel movement while he is eating, he becomes impure on account of both the remnants of food and the voiding of excrement. How does he purify himself? 71. He should first perform the purification, then sip water, fast for a day and a night, and finally take a bath. He is then purified by eating the five products of a cow.

72. If a mendicant throws away any leftovers of his almsfood, he should control his breath three times for each mouthful that he has thrown away. 73. When he enters a village covered with mud during the rains, he should wash his legs and feet, applying earth three times to the legs and seven times to the feet.

19. The meaning appears to be that the ascetic was unaware of the presence of the meat in his almsfood when he started to eat and took the meat into his mouth inadvertently.

10. Penances 167 74. Devala: If water that has touched his hair or beard falls into his bowl, an ascetic should throw away both the bowl and the almsfood in it and observe a fast.

75. Every time he purges, vomits, voids urine or excrement, or eats a meal given by one person, he should, after returning from his begging round, bathe and control his breath three times.

76. Jamadagni: Whenever someone smells liquor, urine, or excrement or the foul odor emanating from a funeral pyre, he should control his breath three times. 77. If an ascetic happens accidentally to see someone vomit or void urine or excrement,20 he is purified by controlling his breath once; but if he does them himself, he should control his breath twice.

78. Gālava: Whenever someone smells the odor of putrid matter, excrement, urine, a funeral pyre, or liquor, he should control his breath.

79-80. He should always observe the constraints and by means of them safeguard the restraints.21 No transgression of the rules of constraint takes place in a time of emergency or physical infirmity; when drinking water or taking medicine; at a sacrificial offering; when Brahmins desire something; when eating flowers, roots, or fruits; with regard to ghee and milk; in carrying out a teacher's command; with regard to bark and leaves;22 and in brushing the teeth, as well as when Brahmins permit something.

81. One should perform the rites for removing sins after Brahmins have loudly proclaimed that day to be holy. By doing so one is freed from sins committed without deliberate intent.

82-83. Bodhāyana: Now they present the following rules for the time when a teacher explains an Upanisad:23 standing; observing silence; sitting down; bathing at 20. Given the opposition between seeing and doing, I think my translation of the first clause is accurate. The phrase literally means "... to see vomit, urine, or excrement." 21. The terms "yama" and "niyama," here translated as "restraints" and "constraints" (see Ch. 5.47), have specific technical connotations within the system of Yoga, but outside that context they are used with widely different meanings. Their exact meanings in this context are unclear. The use of "constraints" with regard to violations of normal rules, however, indicates that the term may here refer to specific restrictive rules. This is the meaning the term "niyama" has in the exegetical tradition of Mimāmsā.

22. The meaning is unclear, and the reading is quite uncertain, as one can judge from the variety of the readings given in the manuscripts.

23. I am not completely sure of the meaning of this elliptic sentence; nor am I sure whether Būhler in the translation of the BDh or Haradatta in his commentary 168 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism dawn, noon, and dusk; observing the vows of eating at the fourth, sixth, or eighth mealtime; keeping the vow of eating grain, oil-cake, barley, curd, and milk.24 It is said: At that time he should observe silence and speak only when there is a need with teachers and sages who have mastered the triple Veda or with learned people belonging to other orders of life, when there is no danger of breaking his vow; even then he should speak pressing his teeth together and keeping the voice within the mouth. Standing, observing silence, and sitting cross-legged-only one of these should he observe at a time and never all three together. It is said: If one goes there, one may follow a guest only a short distance, so also in times of emergency and when there is no danger of breaking his vow.25 In the case of a person who observes faithfully the vows of standing; observing silence; sitting; bathing at dawn, noon, and dusk; and eating at the fourth, sixth, or eighth mealtime, the following eight things do not break his vow: water, roots, ghee, milk, sacrificial offering, the wish of a Brahmin, a command of the teacher, and medicine. [BDh 2.18.15-19] 84. Devala: If someone inadvertently forgets to observe any rule relating to sleep,26 he is purified for certain by silently reciting the triple prayer one thousand times.

85-86. I describe next the expiation of sins committed at night. In this connection, Jābāli the Elder writes: If, after the time for the twilight worship has passed, an ascetic eats at night, all his religious activities-worship, silent prayer, control of breath, and food offerings-will become fruitless; a penance is ordained for him. He should fast for one night and control his breath sixteen times.

fully understood it. The general context of the passage is the enumeration of various vows an ascetic must observe when he studies the Upanisads with a teacher. I have taken the plural ācāryah as merely honorific or as a generic statement; in either case, the singular functions better in English.

24. Būhler, following the commentator, understands the ascetic as standing during the day and sitting during the night. A mealtime occurs twice a day. The vows thus refer to fasting for two, three, or four days; see Ch. 6.106 n. 42.

25. The meaning of this elliptic aphorism is extremely unclear. The critical edition of the BDh reads anuvratayet in place of anuvrajet, but even there the meaning is far from clear. Būhler's rendering follows the commentator, who, I believe, did not have a better idea of what it meant.

26. The term "svapacara" appears to indicate customs and rules relating to sleeping [see Ch. 6.280-86; Ch. 10.97-99], but I am not sure of either the reading or the exact meaning of this passage.10. Penances 169 87. Jamadagni: When someone eats food at night, scriptures prescribe that he control his breath ten times; he should do the same penance also when he fetches water or earth at night.27 88. If what he has collected becomes lost or destroyed, however, he is not defiled by fetching them just once at a flowing river or in a temple.

89. When someone has a seminal discharge at night, he should bathe and control his breath twelve times. By thus controlling his breath, an ascetic recovers his purity completely.

90. Śaunaka: He should not recall the sexual pleasures he formerly enjoyed. If he inadvertently recalls them, he should sip water, control his breath three times, and sip water again. When he inadvertently looks at a woman, he should control his breath. When he enjoys sexual pleasures in a dream, he should silently recite the triple prayer one thousand times and control his breath twelve times. If he has a seminal discharge while enjoying sexual pleasures in a dream, however, he should control his breath twelve times. If he ejaculates he should control his breath twice as much and sip water again. 91. Kapila: When someone enjoys sexual pleasures in a dream, he should bathe and silently recite the triple prayer one thousand times. When someone bleeds after scratching himself, he should observe a fast.

92. Gālava: If someone ejaculates after deliberate masturbation, he should perform three Parāka penances. When one does so involuntarily while having intercourse with a woman in a dream, he should control his breath twelve times. If someone has an involuntary seminal discharge in sleep, he should control his breath twelve times. Every time someone inadvertently sees a woman's private parts, he should control his breath three times, but when he does so in a dream he should perform the Aghamarṣaṇa. Whenever he has an involuntary discharge of semen, he should control his breath sixteen times, but when he ejaculates after voluntary masturbation, he should observe the lunar penance.

93. Jābāli: If someone ejaculates voluntarily or by masturbation, he should control his breath one hundred times and perform three Parāka penances.

94. If someone inadvertently ejaculates during the day, he should perform the following penance. He should control his breath one hundred times as he fasts for three nights.

27. The meaning is that he should not go out to collect earth or water for purification after toilet during the night. He is expected to gather them during the day for use at night.

170 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 95. If he involuntarily ejaculates on seeing a woman because of the weakness of his organ, he should control his breath sixteen times.

96. Vayu: If a mendicant ever ejaculates voluntarily, he should perform three Prajapatya penances and control his breath one hundred times.

97. Parāśara the Elder: "You remain asleep, O Vasudeva, until sunrise. I too will do likewise for the welfare of all creatures." 98. "Seven seers are lodged in the body; seven guard the seat vigilantly. Seven waters went to the world where he sleeps and where two gods who never sleep and sit at the sacrifice keep watch."28 99. Reciting these two mantras, he should sleep. If he fails to recite them, he should control his breath six times and go to sleep again after reciting them. In the morning he should get up reciting the mantra "Rise up, O Brahmanaspati!" [see Ch. 6.4 n. 4]. If he does not recite it, he should control his breath three times and rise up again.

100. Next I describe the penances for transgressing the rules of constraint. In this connection, Vayu states: A penance is prescribed every time a mendicant violates either a major or a minor observance.

101. An ascetic should observe a penance when he deliberately engages in sexual intercourse with a woman. He should perform Krechra penances while he controls his breath for one whole year.

102. Then, after he has humbled himself by intently practicing penances and meditation and attained once again total indifference to worldly things, he should diligently beg for almsfood.

103. Kapila: After engaging in sexual intercourse just once, an ascetic should fast and silently recite the triple prayer one hundred thousand times. If he does so repeatedly for three nights, he should silently recite the triple prayer for a year. If someone has sexual intercourse with a Sudra woman just once, he should live in the wilderness, eating Bilva29 and the like that have fallen 28. VS 34.55. This verse contains a riddle that was obscure enough to be included in a very ancient exegetical work, Yaska's Nirukta (12.37). Yāska gives two explanations, one with reference to cosmic realities and the other with reference to the human body. Thus, the seven seers are rays of the sun or the senses; the body is the sun or the body; seven waters are interpreted as works; and the two gods are wind and sun or the selves of knowledge and luster. The first interpretation refers to the setting sun, and the second to a sleeping person.

29. This is the Bel fruit (Aegle marmelos).

171 10. Penances on their own after washing them and reciting the syllable OM, until he becomes purified through his own death.

104. Jābāli: An ascetic should observe a penance when he deliberately engages in sexual intercourse with a woman. Controlling his breath, he should perform Santapana penances during one whole year.

105. Gālava: If someone has sexual intercourse with a prostitute just once, he should observe the penance prescribed for killing a Brahmin.

106. Atri: An ascetic should do the following to purify himself after committing a grievous sin. The yogin should silently recite the triple prayer one hundred thousand times and control his breath ten thousand times. Then he should silently recite the syllable OM one hundred thousand times.

107. When someone foolishly engages in sexual intercourse with a woman just once, he is purified in the above manner. Also, when a person engages in sex deliberately and repeatedly, he is purified through a penance. 108. Vayu: What people call wealth is truly the lifebreaths that roam outside. When someone steals the wealth of another man, he steals that man's lifebreaths.

109. When an evil ascetic does such a thing, breaking thereby the code of his order of life, he should, after he again becomes indifferent to worldly things, perform a lunar penance for one year in the manner prescribed in the scriptures. So states the Veda.

110. Then, at the end of that year, when he has become pure once again and recovered his indifference to worldly things, a mendicant may beg for almsfood.

111. Gālava: If someone deliberately accepts money, cows, land, sesame seeds, and the like, he should perform a penance as if he had fallen from his caste.

112. Jamadagni: If a man discards something he has accepted, he should fast for three days. By silently reciting the Gayatri verse ten thousand times, a man is freed. from all grievous sins.

113. The same author states: When someone sees a wretched ascetic who accepts land, cattle, or gold, he should bathe by entering the water fully clothed.

114. Vayu: When someone tells a lie with regard to a fast, he should control his breath one hundred times. An ascetic who desires virtue should never tell a lie.

172 115. Gālava: Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism When someone tells a lie, he should fast for three nights. If someone tells a lie for a righteous reason, he should fast for a whole day and control his breath one hundred times.

116. Jamadagni: When someone causes injury to a mobile or an immobile creature by his speech, mind, or actions, he should purify himself through the organ that caused the injury.

117. When the injury is caused by speech, he should restrain his speech; when it is caused by the mind, he should restrain his breaths; and when it is caused by physical acts, he should restrain his actions. With his mind. he should pledge total detachment from worldly things.

118. When a man is lax in restraining his speech, mind, and actions, he destroys his knowledge, his highest goal, and the three worlds, respectively. 119. He should practice silence, the restraint of speech. The restraint of actions is fasting, and the restraint of the mind is the control of breath. 120. When faults are committed, this is the way to expiate them. If he commits them for a very long time, he should perform the stipulated observances twice as long.

121. Gālava: If someone kills a quadruped, he should observe a lunar fast, whereas he should fast for ten nights when he kills a crab, a brightly colored fish or bird, and the like.30 122. If a mendicant deliberately causes injury to cattle or animals, he should perform a Krechra and an Atikṛcchra penance or observe a lunar fast.31 123. Jamadagni: If someone causes an injury to a lizard, a fish,32 a frog, a gecko, or an animal such as an osprey, he should eat half a meal a day for ten days. 124. If someone causes injury to a cat, a mouse, a snake, a large fish, a bird, or an animal such as a mongoose, he should observe a lunar fast. Each time he injures a tiny ant, he should control his breath three times. 125. If a mendicant kills an animal with very small bones, he should perform a penance. He should control his breath thirty times and eat half a meal for one day.

30. The term "citraroman" can refer to any animal that has bright or variegated hair or scales. Since quadruped animals have already been mentioned, it appears likely that the term refers to a brightly colored fish or bird.

31. See Ch. 4.2 n. 1 and Ch. 5.11 n. 5. The Atikṛcchra penance is much like the Prājāpatya, except that the food is limited to just a single mouthful per day.

32. This is just a guess. I do not know what a kṣiragala is, and it is not listed in any dictionary. A kṣīrajala is a kind of fish, and this may be a variant of it.

10. Penances 126. Gālava: If he breaks leaves, roots, sprouts, or flowers, he should control his breath thirty times.

127. Dattatreya: If someone happens to see accidentally a Brahmin who is either naked or without a sacrificial string, he is purified by bathing fully clothed, making twelve applications of earth.

128. Hārīta: If someone feeds a Brahmin who is naked or without a sacrificial string at a funerary offering, he offers thereby semen, urine, and excrement to his ancestors.

129. If a man resorts to a single staff either because he has been talked into it or because of greed and afterward regains the spirit of detachment, he should carry a triple staff like a wise man.

130. He should faithfully perform the Prajapatya penance for a full month, as he bathes at dawn, noon, and dusk, and all the time silently recite the Gayatri verse.

131. But if he wants to complete the penance quickly, he should remain for a day subsisting on air and spend the night standing in water until sunrise; he gains thereby the fruit of a Prajapatya penance.

132. When the sun rises, he should silently recite the Gayatri verse eight thousand times. A man is thereby released from all his sins, unless he is guilty of abortion.

133. When every sin imaginable rises up at once, the Gayatri verse recited ten thousand times becomes the highest means of purification.

134. When one recites three times the Gayatri verse together with the Great Utterances, the syllable OM, and the Siras mantra [see Ch. 5.82], while he controls his breath, it is called "the control of breath." 135. The moment a man performs the control of breath in the manner prescribed and with a composed mind, the sins he has committed during that day and night are destroyed.

136. When a Brahmin sits down at the evening twilight and controls his breath, he is cleared of the sins he has committed during the day by thought, word, and deed.

137. She is a thousand at the highest, a hundred at the middle, and ten at the lowest; the man who always recites this goddess Gayatri is not tainted by sin.

138. Controlling the breath sixteen times every day while reciting the syllable OM and the Great Utterances purifies even an abortionist within a month.

139. The Krechra penance and the lunar fast destroy all sins, even the greatest, whether they involve wrongful actions or incorrectly performed rites.

173 174 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 140-41. Samvarta: Please listen to the expiation meant for those who have fallen from renunciation. If someone returns to the world after he has renounced, that foolish man should tirelessly perform Krcchra penances continuously for six months. This is seen as the means of expiation for a lapsed ascetic.

142. The same author states: For a man learned in the four Vedas who has killed a Brahmin or his teacher,33 one should prescribe the penance associated with the causeway to Lanka. 34 143. Walking barefoot and without an umbrella, such a man should beg for almsfood from all four classes near the causeway to Lanka, announcing publicly his misdeeds.

144. "I am an abject sinner. I have committed the most heinous of sins. Guilty of killing a Brahmin, I stand outside the doors of houses seeking almsfood." 145. Living in cow pens and settlements of cowherds, in towns and villages, and traveling to sacred bathing places, he will finally arrive at the sacred ocean.

146. Then he will see the causeway that leads across the ocean to Lankā, a causeway that is ninety miles wide and nine hundred miles long.

147. After seeing the causeway, he will become immediately purified when he sees the king of the entire world as he performs the horse sacrifice.35 148. Devala: If someone touches a menstruating woman, a prostitute, an intoxicated woman, or a log used to carry a corpse, he should take a bath and silently recite the prayer twice.36 149. The same author states: A penance is prescribed when someone discovers lice on his body. After fasting for one day, he should control his breath six times.

33. The term "brahmahan" may here refer also to a man who metaphorically kills the Veda by giving up his life of renunciation. One who does that would also metaphorically kill the teacher who imparted the Veda to him.

34. This is the group of islands extending from Rameśvaram in India to the northeastern coast of Sri Lanka, today commonly referred to as Adam's Bridge. In the mythology of Rama, this was constructed by Hanuman, the monkey associate of Rama, to facilitate the invasion of Lanka to rescue Sitā from Rāvana.

35. The meaning here is rather unclear. In all likelihood, however, it refers to a penance known as Aśvamedha ("Horse Sacrifice"), in which the sinner takes a bath in the sea or a river at the end of a horse sacrifice performed by a king. This penance is prescribed for the murder of a Brahmin (see Kane, IV, 131).

36. The text does not specify the prayer. In such contexts, it is most often the Gayatri or the triple prayer (see Ch. 5.82).

10. Penances 175 150. Garga: Mendicants should not accept things from one another. If someone thoughtlessly accepts something from another mendicant, he should silently recite the mantra "The fame of Mitra..." [TS 3.4.11.5] and control his breath three times.

151. Gālava: When someone bleeds after scratching himself, he should fast for a day and a night.

152. Jamadagni: He should not even think about his mother, father, or son. If ever he experiences a feeling of love toward them, he should control his breath sixteen times.

153. Satyakāma and Jābāla: If he ever uses the ritual utterances Svāhā, Svadhā, and Vaṣat even once, or has them used,37 everything he does will bear no fruit. He is further required to undergo a penance. If he uses those utterances himself, he should perform three Prājāpatya penances and control his breath twelve times. 154. Satyakāma gives the penance for those sins not mentioned above: When someone violates a prescribed rule, he should control his breath twelve times.

155. The more and the less severe penances given here should be understood as referring to people with physical infirmities, taking into account such factors as time and place. Some, on the other hand, hold that, given the conflict between the opinions of the sages, one is free to choose among the different penances listed.38 156. Other duties not given here, moreover, as well as the penances for their violation, should be gathered from texts on the duties of householders.

157. That ends the tenth chapter, entitled "Penances," of the Collection of Ascetic Laws.

37. These utterances are used at the end of mantras at the moment an offering is made in the fire. Svāhā is used in rites to gods, whereas Svadha is used for ancestral rites. Ascetics are not permitted to perform either type of rite, or have such rites performed on their behalf. This is the meaning of "use" and "have them used.." 38. Yadava has cited numerous texts that give different penances for the same offence. He explains this difference as relating to the different capabilities of the ascetics. Healthy ascetics should perform the more severe penances, while the more lenient penances are meant for the sick and the weak. This is an example of restrictive option (vyavasthitavikalpa) that I discussed earlier (see Ch. 2.25 n. 9). Some would argue, however, that these contradictory penances are an example of textual conflict, permitting a free choice among the various options (vikalpa).

CHAPTER ELEVEN The Procedure of an Ascetic's Funeral 1. I will now describe the procedure of an ascetic's funeral. In connection with this, Bodhāyana states: I will describe the complete procedure of an ascetic's funeral. After purifying himself by taking a bath, a householder should perform the funeral of an ascetic.

2. He should decorate the corpse with perfumes and garlands and place it on a bier. He should carry it toward the east or the north accompanied by the shouts of victory and the sound of drums and take it to a pure place.

3. On a river bank, under a banyan tree, near a temple or a cow pen, or under a Palāsa tree, he should dig the sacrificial ground that is the grave; he should dig it to a depth equal to the height of the ascetic's staff while reciting the Great Utterances. He should sprinkle the grave with water while reciting the Great Utterances, have the corpse bathed while he recites the Puruṣa hymn (RV 10.90), decorate it with perfumes and the like, and place it in the grave, saying, "O Visnu, protect the oblation" [TS 1.1.3.11. He then places the staff in the right hand of the deceased ascetic, saying, "Viṣṇu traversed this..." ITS 1.2.13.1-2]. Then, he should silently recite the mantra "The swan seated in purity..." [TS 1.8.15.2] at the chest of the deceased, the Purusa hymn [RV 10.90] between the eyebrows, and the mantra "Brahman was first born in the east..." [TS 4.2.8.2] at the crown of the head. He should then split the top of the ascetic's head as he recites the mantra "The earth has gone to the earth..." [ApSr 3.20.9; BDh 1.6.7), touching it as he recites the Gayatri verse. He should fill the sacrificial ground of the grave, reciting the syllable OM, and repeatedly purify the area while reciting the Gayatri. If the grave is disturbed by jackals, crows, and the like, the person who performed the funeral would incur a sin and a drought would strike that region. Therefore, he should repeatedly put dirt into the grave until it is completely covered. After performing the funeral, one should not observe a period of impurity or make water offerings. When a man carries or touches the corpse of an ascetic or digs a grave for him, he is puri- 176 11. The Procedure of an Ascetic's Funeral fied immediately and takes a bath similar to the one taken at the end of a sacrifice. At every step a man obtains the reward of a horse sacrifice.

So said the Blessed Bodhāyana.

4. When an ascetic who was established in Brahman dies, his son, pupil, or a householder should bury him. The same person should perform an oblation to Nārāyaṇa' on his behalf.

5. There are no burnt offerings, no libations of water, no funerary offerings, and no feeding of Brahmins. He should perform all the offerings to Nārāyaṇa according to the rules of the funerary offerings made to a newly deceased person.2 6. Sages proclaim this to be the procedure even at the death of a simple ascetic.3 On the eleventh day after death, a Pārvaṇa offering is prescribed.

7. One should never perform the Sapinḍīkarana rite for them, because they do not fall into the ghostly state by the mere fact that they carried a triple staff.4 8. This alone is sufficient for a mendicant devoted to solitude, for no one does anything for him, and he does not do anything for anyone.5 9. There is, moreover, another procedure. He should do everything given before reciting just the Great Utterances. With the same Utterances he should place the corpse in the bier and dig the grave.

177 1. The Nārāyaṇabali is a special offering made after the death of certain individuals, including ascetics, and after certain types of deaths, such as suicide. For a description, see Sp, Ch. 23; for a detailed examination of the rite, see Krick 1977.

2. This type of offering is called the ekoddiṣṭaśraddha and is made during the first eleven days after a person's death. The offerings are made only to that individual. On the twelfth day, the newly deceased is ritually associated with his ancestors in the ceremony known as Sapindikarana. After that ritual, which, as we are informed at Ch. 11.7, is not performed for ascetics, funerary offerings are made in common to the three previous generations of deceased ancestors: father, grandfather, and great grandfather. This common śrāddha is called Pārvaṇaśrāddha.

3. The first two verses addressed the death of an ascetic who had acquired the knowledge of Brahman. Here the same procedure is said to apply even when an ordinary ascetic dies.

4. A newly deceased person remains in a ghostly state (preta) until he is ritually conducted to the world of the fathers through the ritual of Sapindikarana. The deceased in that ghostly state is impure and hovers around the place of his former dwelling. He is then dangerous to his former relatives. The power of the triple staff is believed to conduct a newly deceased ascetic directly to the world of the fathers, bypassing this intermediary state.

5. The phrase is elliptic and ambiguous, and the various scribes appear to have tried to make sense by providing different readings. I think the overall sense is that an ascetic is totally independent and does not need the ritual services of others for his bliss after death, 178 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 10-11. He should again sprinkle water on the grave while reciting the same seven Great Utterances and place the corpse in the grave, reciting the mantra "May god Savitr spur you..." [TS 1.1.1.1]. Putting the bier away, he should place the staff on the deceased ascetic's side, reciting the mantra "Friend, protect me" [see Ch. 4.19], and lay the sling on his chest.

12. He should then place the water strainer on his mouth, reciting the mantra "The purifier with which the gods ever cleanse themselves..." [TB 1.4.8.6], and place the water pot in his right hand with the mantra "You, O Agni, who are wise..." [TS 2.5.12.3).

13. He should similarly place the begging bowl on his stomach, reciting the mantra "The earth has gone to the earth..." [ApSr 3.20.9], worship him with the Hot mantras,7 and sprinkle him with water reciting the seven Great Utterances.

14. He should finally fill the grave as he recites the mantra "Fire by fire is set alight..." [TS 1.4.46.3]; he should do so in such a manner that jackals and dogs would not be able to pull out the corpse.

15. A Brahmin should bury in the ground the bodies of ascetics who had previously maintained a sacred fire, while those of accomplished ascetics who had not maintained a sacred fire he should cremate.

16. He should also perform on their behalf the funerary offering for a newly deceased person, water libations, offerings of rice balls, and rites for the newly deceased, and, in their case, observe also the period of impurity. After one year, moreover, he should perform their Sapindikarana rite according to the prescribed rules. In the case of a mendicant who has attained Brahman, however, one should not perform any rite other than the Pārvaṇa offering (see Ch. 11.5 n. 2].

17. Atri: After purifying himself by taking a bath, the son or a householder should perform the funeral of an ascetic. He should decorate the corpse with perfumes and garlands and place it on a bier.

18. Kindling a fire with chaff, he should carry it along for the ascetic's last rite. He should proceed toward the east or the north accompanied by the shouts of victory and the sound of drums and go to a pure place.

19. He should dig a grave as deep as the ascetic's staff while reciting the Great Utterances, sprinkle the grave with water reciting the seven Great Utterances, and make on it a wooden pyre.

20. According to his ability, he should use logs that are suitable for a sacrifice or others that are not objectionable. Then, with a pure mind, he should wash the corpse reciting the Gayatri verse.

6. The reading piṣtapraskanda adopted in the edition is far from certain and its meaning, as well as that of the variant readings recorded in the mss, is far from clear.

7. These are the mantras of the ten Hotr contained in the TA 3.7. The full text is found in App. 1.12.11. The Procedure of an Ascetic's Funeral 21. After laying the corpse on the pyre as he recites the mantra "O Visṇu, protect the oblation" ITS 1.1.3.1], he should place the water strainer on the mouth, reciting the mantra "The purifier with which the gods ever cleanse themselves..." [TB 1.4.8.6].

22. He should place the triple staff in the right hand, reciting the mantra "Viṣṇu traversed this..." [TS 1.2.13.1-2], and the sling in the left hand with the mantra "May that bright light born beyond the atmosphere..." [TS 4.2.5.2] and concluding with "Svāhā!" 23. Conversant with the rules, he should place the begging bowl on the stomach while reciting the Gayatri verse, and the water pot on the lap with the mantra "The earth has gone to the earth..." [ApSr 3.20.9].

24. The performer of the funeral should consecrate the corpse that has been laid on the pyre in the grave and on which his equipment has been placed and worship it, while reciting the Hotṛ mantras. He should then cremate the body until it is turned completely to ash.

25. Scriptures prescribe for a Brahmin the rites beginning with the impregnation ceremony and ending with cremation. Therefore, a householder performs the funerary rite of even an ascetic using the appropriate mantras.

26. When his father has proclaimed the Praiṣa formula [see Ch. 4.27 n. 26] after depositing the sacred fires in himself, the son should make the sacred fires descend once again and cremate him according to the rules.

27. When a father who had been devoted to ritual activities even after renunciation dies, his sons should carry out his cremation and perform the funerary offerings, libations of water, and offering of rice balls on his behalf.

28. If, following the alternative method, a person becomes an ascetic at the very beginning while he was still a vedic student, a householder should perform all his funerary rites in the presence of Viṣṇu.

29. After carrying, touching, or cremating the corpse of an ascetic, a person is purified by just taking a bath, and at every step he obtains the reward of a horse sacrifice.

30. Śaunaka: In the case of an ascetic who had suppressed all his attachments and had been devoted to the practice of meditation, neither cremation nor the offering of water and rice balls should be performed.

179 8. The depositing of fires in the self or the fire drills was performed also when a Brahmin set out on a journey. According to the Vedic ritual texts, that Brahmin can reproduce his fires (literally make them descend) by using the mantra: "Descend again, O fire..." (TB 2.5.8.8). For this ritual, see AsSr 3.10.6; ApSr 6.28.12. Our source expects the son of the deceased ascetic to likewise reestablish the sacred fires that his father had deposited in himself prior to his renunciation.

9. For a discussion of this alternative, see Ch. 2.11-24.

180 Rules and Regulations of Brahmanical Asceticism 31. The corpse of an ascetic devoted to meditation should be placed in a grave while just the syllable OM is recited. One should get everything done-sprinkling the corpse, digging the grave, and so forth-while reciting just that syllable.

32. After carrying or touching the corpse of an ascetic, a person is purified by just taking a bath, and at every step everyone who participates obtains individually the reward of a horse sacrifice.

33. This same procedure has been given by the Blessed Lord Yajnavalkya the Elder.10 146. That ends the eleventh chapter, entitled "The Procedure of an Ascetic's Funeral," of the Collection of Ascetic Laws composed by Yadava Prakāśa.

10. See App. 1.11 for this passage of Yajnavalkya the Elder.
