## आचार्याः समाश्रयणे
### आचार्य-दीक्षा
<details><summary>पाञ्चरात्र-क्रियाधिकारः</summary>

> That rule regarding the 5 gotras belonging to kanva shakha of sukla yajur Veda is mentioned in jayakhya. And it is abt adhikara to touch moola vigraha in temple. Ramanuja, tatarya etc don't claim such rights in temples governed by jayakhya (eg. kAnchi varadarAja).
>
> There are other samhitas where any brahmana who has underwent pancaratra diksha is allowed certain rights.. and iirc sattvata allows any brahmana with diksha to become acharya. So madhva and Sri vaishnava acharyas use this rule.

### स्वयमाचार्य-परम्पराः
> A previous pontiff (श्रीमुश्नम् आण्डवन् इति प्रसिद्धः श्रीमद् रङ्गरमानुज महादेशिकन्) of Andavan Ashramam has recommended that svayamacharya families try their best to continue the samasrayana practice within the family even if it may be suboptimal for as long as possible and only come to Him for prapatti.

- Met देशिकाचार्यदीक्षित, a vAdyAr, (whose great-grandfather was an AhitAgni in shAntigrAma, KA), who comes from a family which has been doing samAshrayaNa for nearby folks, as a representative of the ANDavan, since olden days.

### आचार्य-चिति-प्रकारः
- पितुर् आचार्य एवोपसर्पणीय इति केचित्। नैवम् इत्यपरे। पिता न समाश्रितवान् चेत् स्वातन्त्र्यम् इति केचिद् अपि।

## विधिः
- साधारणः समाश्रयणविधिर् [अन्यत्रोक्तः](../prayogamAlA/panchasmskArAdi/) । 

### Shortcuts in factory model
> Pancaratra paddhati allows the yati to appoint someone for the homa. 
> 
> But I find the large mathas somewhat following a mass production formula. Eg. Nama homas r not done. Several other homa related things are shortened. Samhara and srishti nyasas are not performed on the sishya by the acharya.. several such shortcuts.

### उपसर्पणम्
ANDavan Ashrama makes you recite:

<div class="js_include" url="/purANam_vaiShNavam/mahAbhAratam/06-bhIShma-parva/03-bhagavad-gItA-parva/saMskRtam/vishvAsa-prastutiH/02_sAnkhya-yogaH_sarva-/07_kArpaNyadoShopaha.md"  newLevelForH1="5" includeTitle="false"> </div>  

### नाम-होमः
> The Parasara-visista-parama-dharma-sastra which is largely the basis for the panchasamskara performed today explicitly allows for the skipping of the nAma-samskara if the individual has been given a Srivaishnava nAma at birth, cauLa or upanayana.

### ताप-संस्कारः
Ahobila MaTha uses dhUpa for heating the emblem. They don't do any homa. They claim that since the mudras were given by the Lord Himself, there is no need for homa.

## भरन्यास आचार्यः
> Bharanyasam was generally taken from the most exalted acharya of the generation.. so gopalarya mahadesikans times saw most of the svayamacharya families undergo bharanyasam with him.
> 
> There are thozhappachars who hv remained outside gopalarya tradition. But then they have taken bharanyasam from parakala matha in past.
> 
> - Ravilochana


> Also many sought Vazhur Andavan and Periyandavan, especially the latter. Many great scholars sought him after this incident (Tirupputkuzhi Swamy taking bharanyAsa). Until then he was relatively unknown as he shyed away from sadases and didn't particularly do any kalakshepam etc. People even thought he was not that erudite. This was before Andavan Ashramam was formed as an organization. Until then the 3 sanyasis of this parampara (Vazhutur-Tirutturaipundi-Periya-andavans) lived on the banks of the Kaveri sleeping under bushes mostly.
