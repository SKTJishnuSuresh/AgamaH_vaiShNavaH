Bhagavān is declared in the Upaniṣads to be Himself the means (upāya) of attaining Him. The ways of bhakti and prapatti are indicated for winning His grace. The adoption of these [^46] *ways is the result of the great ripening of meritorious deeds (done in the past ) and, even for this, Bhagavān, who has the ability to create everything, is Himself the cause.

[^46]: These ways: The commentary Sārāsvādinī says that the Sanskrit   word Gati does not mean here ways or upāyas but forms of knowledge.

UPĀYA AND UPEYA:

The means or upāya to be adopted by them (i.e.) the seekers after mukti) is a special kind of expansion of knowledge. The upeya or object of attainment which can be realised by this means is another special kind of expansion of knowledge. Of these, the special kind of expansion of knowledge which is the means requires the help of instruments of knowledge (karaṇa ) and has been prescribed in the Śāstras. It has for its object Brahman who is always endowed with the five attributes like satyam, (satyam, jñānam, anantan,anandam, amalatvam ) which define His essential nature or substance ( svarūpa), along with the qualities Associated invariably with the respective vidyā or form of meditation. The object of attainment (upeya) which is a special kind of expansion of knowledge does not require any instruments of knowledge. It is the natural heritage of the jīvātmā and has for its object Brahman perfect with all qualities and glorious possessions (vibhūtis).

ŚLOKA:

उपासितगुणादेर्या प्राप्तावप्यबहिष्क्रिया ।  
सा तत्क्रतुनयग्राह्या नाकारान्तरवर्जनम् ॥

The principle of tatkratu[^47] states only that  the qualities (and forms) meditated upon would not be excluded in the attainment; it does not exclude other qualities (and forms ). Service to the Lord is also the object of attainment (upeya ) as it is the overflow of the experience (of Bhagavān ) which is attained.

[^47]: The principle of tatkratu or tatkratu nyaya is to the effect that in whatever form or manner and with whatever qualities one meditates on God - in that very form and with those very qualities will one attain Him. Though service to the Lord is not specifically prescribed in a vidyā, it will be attained after mukti.

BHAGAVÃN IS BOTH UPĀYA AND UPEYA:

Iśvara is the object of the knowledge which is the means, upāya, and is also the object of the knowledge which is attainment : He is the means or Upāya as being the giver of the (desired) fruit and, likewise. He is Upeya because He is Himself the object that is to be enjoyed. In the case of the mumukṣu who has adopted prapatti as the sole and independent means, Iśvara takes the place of other upāyas. In the case of others also (i, e.) those who adopt bhakti, Iśvara whose favour has been won by prapatti (adopted as an auxiliary means to bhakti) intervenes and, standing in the place of rites and duties which are too hard for them in those situations which lie between the beginning of karma yoga and the completion of the (prescribed) meditation, brings about the removal of sins and the manifestation of sattvam which can result from their performance. He sees to it that the meditation or worship which has been adopted as an upāya is so complete as to bear fruit.

KARMA YOGA:

Karma Yoga means the performance of certain kinds of karma or rites and duties as the result of knowledge acquired from the śāstras in regard to the true nature of the Jīvātmā and the Paramātmā. The rites and duties consist of the following: (1) nitya karna or regular duties to be performed compulsorily (like the daily sandhya vandana) (2) naimittika karma or rites to be compulsorily performed on specific occasions (like the eclipse of the sun or the moon) and (3) such kārya karmās or rites as are optional and as have been chosen to be within one's ability. Though these kāıya rites are ordained for obtaining certain specified fruits like svarga, they have to be performed without any desire for those fruits. All these rites and duties, 1, 2 and 3, have to be performed regularly and in accordance with the prescribed rules by the Karma-yogin.

This karma yoga has several subdivisions described in the śloka s beginning with "Some perform the rites or sacrifices (Yajna) which are of the nature of the worship of the Gods" (Bhagavadgītā IV 25.) They include such (items) as the adoration of the gods, the performance of austerities (tapas), pilgrimage to sacred places, giving in charity, and sacrifices.

In the same way as, in accordance with the differences of competence, prapatti becomes the means of attaining mukti, either through bhakti or directly by itself and without the intervention of bhakti, so also karma yoga, either through Jñāna Yoga or without it, becomes the means of having a vision of one's

or ātmā with the help of yogic auxiliaries like yama (self-rest raint), niyama (observance of rites) and prāṇāyāma (the control of the breath).

JÑĀNA YOGA:

Jñāna Yoga is the constant and uninterrupted contemplation, by one who has conquered his mind by karna-yoga, of his svarūpa or essential nature or the self as being distinct from matter, (the body, the senses and the like) - his svarūpa which is the mode or prakāra of Iśvara in virtue of its relation to Him as His body or śarīra. The self is the body of Iśvara ( as has been already pointed out) because it is supported and controlled by Him and serves His purposes.

If a person has succeeded in attaining to a vision of his self ( ātmāvalokana) by the practice of yoga preceded by karma yoga and Jñāna yoga and if he escapes the spare of being (permanently) attracted by the pleasure of enjoying this vision which is so great as to create a distaste for all sense-pleasures - then he begins the practice of bhakti yoga which is (the direct) means for the attainment of the supreme goal of enjoying Bhagavān. While practising bhaktiyoga, the aspirant contemplates on Bhagavān as the Inner Self, or antaryāmin of his own self which is His body. The vision that he has (already ) acquired of his own pure self is then useful, for it is only through it that he reaches its Inner Self, just as the cloth within which a gem is tied up is first to be seen before the gem itself can be seen. In this way the vision of one's self serves as a qualification for the practice of bhakti yoga.

BHAKTI YOGA:

Bhakti yoga is the special form of meditation which is of the nature of unsurpassed love and which has, for its object, the essential nature and the like (form, qualities, etc.) of Bhagavān who is not dependent on any one else, who is not subject to the authority of any one else and who does not exist for the fulfilment of the purposes of any one else. Bhakti is of the form of a continuous stream of knowledge which is of the nature of uninterrupted memory like oil streaming down continuously; it has clearness similar to that of visual perception; it grows from strength to strength by being practised every day until the day of journey to Paramapada and terminates in the remembrance of the last moment. The performance of the rites and duties of one's varṇa and āśrama is auxiliary to it (bhakti yoga ), as it dispels sins that cause rajas and tamas, which, like weeds, impede the growth of sattvam so necessary for the expansion of knowledge. This bhakti yoga is also a means or sadhana in accordance with the specific desire of the sādhaka, for acquiring lordship (in this world or in svarga) and other fruits (like kaivalya). This is. calculated to strengthen the faith of the weak-minded as stated in the śloka  ; "Worldly' benefits have also been mentioned as arising from bhakti-yoga. They produce confidence in the attainment of mukti (by verifying what is stated in the śāstra  from the example of these worldly benefits). This idea is expressed in the śloka  in the Gita (7-16) which says: "Four kinds of persons worship me etc.” The superiority of the Jnāni which is stated there in the words, " Among them, the Jñāni is the best because he desires to be always with Bhagavān and is devoted solely and exclusively to Him" is thus described by Bhagavān Himself com " Four *kinds of people are my men. They are all devotees (bhaktas). Of them they who worship me alone exclusively are the best, for they do not approach other deities. They perform the prescribed rites and duties without caring for their fruits and desire to attain me alone. The other three kinds of devotees desire ( worldly) fruits which have an end and they are subject to lapses. The wise man who worships me with sole and exclusive devotion attains mokṣa ."

Bhakti yoga which has thus been prescribed as the means of obtaining mokṣa  has been called parābhakti. Love of the Lord which results from intimacy with sāttvikas (and the scriptures ) and which produces parābhakti is also called bhakti, because it generates an eager desire to know Iśvara with perfect clearness. It has been said: "Owing to smy devotion to the Lord and to my gurus, I have attained spiritual purity and come to know Janārdana with the help of the Śāstras." (So parābhakti is born successively of a knowledge of the truth obtained from the śāstras which leads to karma yoga and the like). It (parābhakti) produces in its turn an eager desire and determination to see the Lord and makes the man cry out as follows- "O Lord, 'who art the abode of attributes like jñāna, be pleased to show Thy whole self 1" “Vouchsafe Thy grace so that I may see Thee": "May I see Thee some day!" By this keen desire alone, he wins the grace of Bhagavān who rewards him with a perfect visual perception of himself for the time being. This visual perception is called parajñāna. From this perfect vision of the svarūpa of the Lord is born an excessive and unsurpassed love for the Lord similar to the yearning feltt by a man suffering from great thirst at the sight of a tank. This (excessive and unsurpassed love for the Lord) is called parama bhakti, Parama bhakti produces an eager desire and determination to enjoy the Lord without any limitations, as the bhakta feels that it is impossible to live any longer without this experience of the Lord as described in the Tiruvoymozhi 10.10-1 (where the Alwar cries out that he will not hereafter allow the Lord to leave him) and that he must become one with the Lord and declares all this with an oath that cannot be ignored by the Lord. It causes (likewise) an excessive eagerness in the Lord to give him mokṣa  immediately and makes him attain mokṣa  after quenching his great thirst for union.

BHAKTI AND PRAPATTI:

(Prapatti stands in the place of parābhakti to the man who adopts it as the direct and independent means). Siace bhakti yoga is not suitable for those who do not belong to the three higher castes and (likewise) also for those in these three castes who are wanting in jñāna or ability or both and since it will not suit those who cannot endure any delay in the attainment of its fruit (namely, mokṣa) and are therefore extremely impatient, prapatti is prescribed as the sole and independent means of mokṣa  for them. Since it will be the means of securing all desired objects, it has been prescribed in the place of parābhakti for those who know their limitations. Just as in the case of the man who practises the vidyās, parābhakti is followed by (certain) stages of attainment (like para jñāna ), this prapatti will be followed by certain favourable results or states in accordance with the desire of the man who adopts it as the independent upāya. These states are to be considered as part of the fruits of prapatti.

CLASSIFICATION OF UPĀYAS

Thus prapatti and bhakti are said to be optional in relation to those who are qualified for them as they secure the same final goal or fruit.

BHAKTI IS DIFFERENT FROM PRAPATTI:

That the two are different from each other is evident from the adhikaraṇa or section. "The Brahma Vidyās are different as their *[^48] names and the like are different ". Brahma sūtras (III-3.56). That there is option (to choose any of them) is also evident from the section : " There is option (to adopt any of them ) because the result or (final) fruit is the same". Brahnia sītras (III - 3. 57).

[^48]: Bhakti leads through yoga to para-bhakti which leads to para-Jñāna, which, in its turn, leads to parama-bhakti.

It may be seen that, as in upāsanās there are differences in mantras and the like (aṅgas), there are, in Nyāsa Vidyā also, differences stated in the different branches of the vedas (Shakhas) and in the different samhitas of the agamas. Just as obeisance (namaskāra) is divided into three forms, verbal, mental and bodily, so prapatti, too, is said to be of different kinds owing to the excess of one or other of these differences. It has been stated by some that, just as obeisance becomes complete when all the three, verbal, mental and bodily are combined, prapatti, too, becomes complete when verbal and bodily actions are combined with mental states or jñāna. This statement of theirs should be understood as meaning that mental prapatti is full and complete and that verbal and bodily activities are, as it were, the overflow of the mental prapatti (jñāna). (It should not be taken to mean that prapatti is incomplete when verbal and bodily actions are absent). We have already stated that all these are productive of the desired result or fruit in accordance with the competency of those who adopt them,

They are Brahmins who know the following :-- (1) Karma Yoga is suited to one's state (viz. varṇa, āśrama and the like); (2) Jñāna Yoga adopted with keen intelligence on account of its beneficial results: (3) Bhakti Yoga adopted by those with an inner vision which is delightful and (4) Prapatti which yields immediate fruit by the grace of God to those who are destitute of the qualifications (for the other three ) and who cannot endure delay in attaining mokṣa .

Karma, Jñāna, Upāsana (bhakti ) and likewise śaraṇāgati are the good ways prescribed in the Vedas for securing mokṣa[^49] ; of these some are indirect and auxiliary means (namely, karma and jñāna ) while the others, bhakti and śaraṇāgati are direct and independent upāyas for mukti. Of these, some (i.e. karma and jñāna), have only one form (that of being in. direct and auxiliary means ); bhakti has only one form (that of being the direct and independent means for mukti, while śaraṇāgati or prapatti has two forms, that of being an indirect and auxiliary means as leading to bhakti and also that of being the direct and independent means or upāya for obtaining mukti. The wise (who know the s'ăstras), having understood well the difference among these upāyas due to their having this single or twofold nature, delight in the last words (caramaśloka  ) of the charioteer who is the Saviour of all, (i.e.) they prefer śaraṇāgati),

[^49]: Commentators of Brahma sūtras like Sudarśana Bhatta point out that this difference in names applies especially to nyāsa, since it is a different word from 'contemplate', ‘meditate', and 'adore' which are used in connection with the other vidyās and which mean thc same thing, whereas nyāsa has a different meaning (altogether).
