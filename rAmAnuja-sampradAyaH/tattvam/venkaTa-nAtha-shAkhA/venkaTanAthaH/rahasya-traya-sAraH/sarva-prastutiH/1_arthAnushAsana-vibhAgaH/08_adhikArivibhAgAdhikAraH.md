Even though the desire for mokṣa  is the same,  
a distinction arises among those who practise the vidyās or forms of meditation prescribed in the śrutis,  
as a result of their respective qualifications[^42] or competence in regard to such vidyās as Madhuvidyā, Sadvidyā and so on.  
In the same way, a distinction arises between the adoption of prapatti and other vidyās (which are of the nature of bhakti or devout meditation),  
as a result of an unseen power or destiny  
depending on past karma  
which brooks no questioning.

[^42]: 

    Some aspirants for mokṣa  are qualified for madhu vidyā  
    and others for sadvidyā  
    as a result of their respective competence or special forms of aspiration.  
    So also some are qualified for prapatti,  
    while others are for bhakti.

UKTINIṢṬHĀ:

Of these, that done by one's utterance (uktiniṣṭhā) is as follows: Those who have no clear knowledge of auxiliaries (aṅga), such as the determination to do what is agreeable (to the Lord), but who possess the qualification of knowing that, without, the Lord, they have no other means (a kinchanya) and who have. also the faith (viswāsa) that He will grant salvation if prayed to - they pronounce, before the Saviour, the sentence taught to them by their ācārya s, which will be considered by the Lord as equivalent to perfect prapatti; they say: "May my salvation be Thy burden or responsibility !?" They are like the ignorant children of feudatory princes who seek the protection of the emperor by repeating the words taught to them by their nurses. If a little boy who does not understand the meaning of words and sentences says, once, " Madam, give me food as alms", it meets: with immediate and favourable response in the houses of good men who are well.to do. In the same way, it has been said, The Lord, whose wealth never suffers any diminution, however much He may give, will also grant whatever is prayed for". Since He is supremely rich and generous, even this utterance or ukti will never be fruitless. In the case of those who are ignorant and who depend entirely on this utterance, the compassion of the Lord, who is the refuge of all, cannot ignore even this mere utterance (as it cannot digest it); for it has been said, “Whatever may be the manner or form, you have uttered the Dvaya Mantra. Therefore your redemption is my responsibility." This truth has been stated by those who are well versed (in the śāstra s) in such śloka s as the following: "Though I am a sinner, it will not become Thee, who art the Lord of all, to neglect me when I utter the words stating that I seek Thy refuge." "This speech of mine expressing the thought that I seek refuge under Thee is not uttered with all my mind and with all my heart. I can be saved only if even this mere utterance will secure Thy compassion." "I long to see Thee by merely uttering the words of prapatti - Thee who canst not be attained by bhakti." The state of one who performs prapatti by utterance (ukti), and that of one who depends solely on the ācārya  have both been described in the same śloka  as follows:- "I have been made Thy responsibility by my ācārya s who follow the way of dharma. I have also (myself) uttered the word seeking refuge. Taking this into consideration, O, Lord of Śrīraṅgam, make me Thy burden or responsibility" The word api (also) in the śloka  indicates that any one of the two will suffice.

ĀCĀRYANISHȚHĀ ;

Of the two, the one who depends solely on the ācārya  is included in the ācārya 's own prapatti as part of it, for it has been laid down in Śāṇḍilya Smṛti and other treatises as follows: “He should also state thus: “This is my son, my servant, my disciple (who is to be saved)". It has been said: “There may be doubts concerning (the redemption of) those that serve Acyuta, but there is absolutely no doubt about the (redemption) of those who delight in the service of His devotees". So, in the case of those who depend solely on the ācārya , there is no doubt at all concerning the fruition of prapatti, by the principle of "How much more, then" (kaimutika nyāya).

Mudali Andan said: "When a lion leaps from one hill to another, the little creatures (like bugs and lice) on his body are also taken over from that hill to the other. So also when the author of Śrī Bhāṣya performed prapatti (the surrender of his responsibility or bhara), we "too have been saved (by that act)[^44] owing to our intimate connection with him." We, too, have expressed this idea in Nyāsa Tilaka as follows:- " The blind man walks on being led by one who is not blind; the lame man is taken (across the stream) by the boatman, being placed within the boat; the children of the king's servants enjoy the pleasures (of the palace), although they do not know the king. So also my ācārya , who is compassionate, is capable of making me attain Thee, O Lord of Śrīraṅgam". It comes to this that the Lord of all will not be gracious enough to grant us the supreme goal of existence, unless prapatti is performed in some manner or other and by some one or other.

[^44]: This is interpreted in two different ways by the southern school of Viśiṣṭādvaitins and the northern school. The former hold that since Śrī Rāmānuja has already performed prapatti, even his followers of a later day who acknowledge him as their ācārya  will benefit by it and they need not perform prapatti; the latter hold, on the other hand, that only those who were his śiṣyas then would benefit by it

.

The favour of Bhāgavatas, residence in holy places and the like are not direct and independent means for attaining mokṣa . (It is true that we find such passages as the following in the śāstra s):-"Whether it be a beast or a man or a bird - those who are held by Bhāgavatas as their own will go to the supreme abode of Viṣṇu  for that very reason". “We, who live in your territories, should be protected by you, for you are our king, O ruler of men, whether you are in the town or in the forests''. "All the beings in Ayodhya which contained (many) good regions - whether they were beings that moved or beings that could not move - he enabled them (all) to acquire nobility of nature". The nobility was that of feeling delight in the company of ŚrīRāma and grief in separation from him. "The strength that lies in living in places where Thou hast temples is the strength that enables a man to attain mokṣa ". (From these passages, it might appear, at first sight, that the favour of Bhāgavatas or God's devotees and the fact of living in places belonging to the Lord would lead of themselves to the supreme goal.) But even here there is always some connection with either prapatti by one's owa utterance or prapatti through the ācārya  or bhakti or prapatti which existed before or bhakti or prapatti which followed. It may be asked how this could be. (The answer is as follows:-) They will lead to bhakti or prapatti. In the case of one who has already adopted bhakti or upāsanā, they will promote the further development of the upāya or means. In the case of one who has performed prapatti as an independent means, they will promote the eagerness for service while in this world. It is in this way they render help.

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BHAKTI AND PRAPATTI

IN SECURING THE GOAL: Among these, he who has adopted prapatti as the means to bhakti is capable, like Vyāsa and others, of other means or upāyas than prapatti and is therefore not absolutely helpless (akiñcana ). Since he can bear delay (in attaining mokṣa ), he is not averse to other interests (in life). He will attain mokṣa  only at the expiry of the karma which has already begun to yield fruit (prārabdha), when he will have the intense thought of the last moment before death. Since the primary upāya or means (aṅgī) which he has chosen is upăsana or bhakti, he attains the fruit thereof, namely, mokṣa , when it is performed fully and in accordance with the rules and injunctions prescribed for it. On the other hand, prapatti adopted as the primary or direct means (aṅgī) is open to all adhikārīs, is capable of averting all hindrances (to mokṣa), can further the attainment of all that is desired, is easy of performance, has to be performed only once, can bring about the fulfilment (of what is aimed at ) quickly and will not countenance any opposition or obstacle. Like the missile, Brahmāstra, it will not tolerate the adoption of any other means or upāya for attaining the fruit. The man who has resorted to prapatti as the direct and independent means will have no hindrances at all in the way of his attaining the perfect enjoyment (of the bliss of Bhagavān). Therefore from the moment of the performance of prapatti, there is nothing in the way of his attaining mokṣa  but his own desire to live till the death

of this body so that he may enjoy such things as the rendering of service with this body to the images of the Lord (arcā) to which he has an attachment. So his mokṣa  has to await only the death of this body and will consist in the rendering, in Vaikuṇṭha  , of perfect and full service which has begun even here in the performance of service limited by the conditions of place, time and the nature of bodily life (svarūpa ). The state of the prapanna who is prepared to continue in this world till the dissolution of the body is referred to in passages like the following: "What is there" wrong in us who go about here having already won the grace of being permitted to serve Thee " "Leaving this bliss of uttering Thy names, I do not want even the bliss of going to Paramapada and ruling over it." "Can I indeed give up the hare and go in pursuit of the crow !" (That is--- it would be foolish to give up hare's flesh which is excellent as food and go after crow's flesh. So also the service of the image here in temples is superior even to the bliss of serving the Lord in Paramapada). “My deep love to Thee, "O King, is always staunch. So also my devotion to Thee, O valiant Sire, is always firnı. Nowhere else can my mind turn". (In these words Hanuman expresses his love and devotion to ŚrīRāma and states that this love and devotion are greater towards Rāma than even to the Lord of Paramapada).

Since the Supreme Ruler is the giver of all things, and since prapatti at His feet is capable of yielding all kinds of fruit, it becomes the means of securing whatever fruit is desired respectively by these two (bhakta and prapanna [^45] ). The Śāstras say, "Ask any boon that you want, when I am in the range of one's vision, all (good) things will follow." "O Thou that hast created all the worlds! Is there anything that is difficult to obtain, when Thou art pleased ? "   " When He is graciously disposed, is there anything here that cannot be obtained ? "   " What is there in this world or in the world above, O Dalbhya, that cannot be accomplished by those men whose minds are directed towards Viṣṇu  ?" "The fruit is from Him. It stands to reason ". (Brahma Sūtras 3 - 2 - 37). Bhakti or upāsana is the means of securing the four kinds of objects that may be desired in accordance with one's aim as stated in the Bhagavad Gitā (7 - 16). "Four types of men who have performed meritorious deeds worship me. He who has lost his wealth and is anxious to recover it, he who wants to have a vision of his own self (ātmā) and to enjoy it (ātmānubhava ), he who wants to acquire wealth anew, and he who is a Jnāni, who desires to be for ever with the Lord and practises bhakti for attaining Him." Similarly have not the great rishis declared that prapatti is also the means of attaining the four kinds of objects or aims as is stated in the śloka  : "Only so long as one does not perform prapatti to Thee that canst destroy all sins, will there be the anxiety to recover lost wealth, only so long will there be the desire to acquire new wealth, only so long will there be the absence of the enjoyment of one's self as something different from the body; only so long will there be the sorrow of saṁsāra". From the words " that destroyest all sins” and the repetition of "only so long" repeated in every case with great consideration, it is made clear that the fruit which is desired by the man will all become his, in accordance with his desire and at the very time when he desires to have it. It is in consideration of this superior efficacy of prapatti that it is stated (in Lakṣmī  Tantra 17 - 62) as follows:-" Those who practise Jñāna Yoga and Bhakti Yoga with a pure mind and those who perform karma which would discipline the soul in renunciation are not worth even one ten-millionth part of the man who has performed prapatti. The difference in the kinds of service done here (in this life) by the prapanna is due to the difference in the desire of the prapanna and that difference in the desire is due to the difference in the meritorious deeds of the past which have begun to operate in this life (Prārabdha karma ). There will be no difference at all in the bliss that will be attained after casting off the last body.

[^45]: The sentence means that the direct' prapanna gets mokṣa  which he desires and the prapanna who performs prapatti for the sake of bhakti gets bhakti which he desires, for prapatti can secure whatever is desired.]

THE BLISS IN MOKṣA  IS THE SAME FOR BOTH.

Entire dependence on the Lord is uniformly the same for all. For it is stated in Viṣṇu  Tantram :-"Having understood his absolute dependence on the Supreme Person, he gets rid of the bondage due to past karma, attains peerless independence and enjoys bliss with him." It has been declared (by the Bhāṣyakāra in the chapter on the Goal (Chapter IV of the Brahma Sūtras) that this independence which is said to be acquired in the final stage of attainment (i.e.) mokṣa  is  fitness to render every kind of service to the Lord without being subject to past karma.

Those who desire to attain the bliss of Bhagavān realise that the supreme aim of life is mokṣa  and that there are two upāyas or means attaining it, one prolonged and the other quick which depend on their luck. They adopt one of these two upāyas and find that, for getting rid of the hindrances caused by past karma, there is no other way than seeking the feet of Mukunda for refuge,

Mukunda does not vouchsafe His abode to any one other than the prapanna. The prapanna is of two kinds, namely, he who adopts prapatti as the sole and independent means and he who adopts prapatti as the auxiliary means to bhakti or upāsana and this difference is due to difference in the fruition of their good deeds. He who adopts prapatti as an auxiliary to bhakti will attain mokṣa  after much delay caused by the need to expiate past karma (in one or several bodies), but will have the happiness of devout worship in this world for a long time. He to whom prapatti is the sole and independent means will attain mokṣa  quickly (i.e.) at the end of this life itself, but his happiness of serving the Lord in this world will be limited and of short duration.
