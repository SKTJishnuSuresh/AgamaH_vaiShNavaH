The delusion that the soul is nothing but the body and the senses (prakṛti)  
disappears when one has a knowledge of the distinctive features of sentient beings and non-sentient things.  
So also the disputes on such questions as the unity of the jīva and God will no longer continue,  
when the characteristic features of each of them are marked out.  
Our ācārya-s, whose wisdom never failed,  
teach us about the existence of three realities (Tattvas)  
classified in the s'āstrās as the experiencing subjects (bhoktā), 
 the objects of experience and enjoyment (bhogyam)  
and He who rules over both of them (Iśvara).

It may be asked -  

> why the ācāryas should state that the three tatvās or 'reals' should be specially prescribed for the study of those who seek mokṣa , when they form only a part of the six things that should be known, namely, the five truths arthapañcaka and the relationship of soul and body (which exists between God and the world)? 

The answer is as follows: 

It is necessary to root out the delusion that the body is the atma and that the jīva is independent (of the Lord), as well as the view that there is no God, which is the cause of that delusion, for these are great obstacles to mokṣa.

The additional characteristic possessed by svarüpajñāna (or the self) is subjectiveness or inwardness (pratyaktva). Jñāna or knowledge, (which is the character of both of them), may be defined as that which makes a thing laminous; that is, it makes either itself or something else fit for being spoken out and acted upon (vyavahāra). Self-luminosity is the capability of being luminous without the need of any other known ledge to illumine it. Attributive knowledge has vishayitva, because it discloses objects other than itself (like pots, cloths etc.) The subjectiveness or inwardness of souls or ātmās (pratyaktva) consists in their being luminous to themselves ; that is, the benefit of their luminosity is enjoyed by themselves The atma or self is the recipient of the benefit of every object being disclosed or revealed. Pratyaktva is only a special instance of this general statement, for in it, the self receives the benefit of its own disclosure or revelation. A thing which does not possess this pratyaktva or subjectiveness does not also possess the common benefit of objects being disclosed. It cannot, therefore, be called sentient. Though subjective knowledge or the 'I' and attributive knowledge, which is its attribute, are both luminous by themselves, yet they are also capable of being apprehended by other forms of knowledge (like that from śāstras), as being endowed with attributes like being eternal. When one's attributive knowledge happens to be known or apprehended by one with the help of another piece of knowledge, the latter is called another piece of knowledge, merely because of the direction to which the attributive knowledge is turned. When we perceive an object, say a pot, dharmabhūtajñāna contacts the object and reveals it to the soul or self; but when the dharmabhūta jñāna itself becomes the object of knowledge, it is revealed to the self  by a part of it.

THE THREE KINDS OF NON-SENTIENT BEINGS :

The three classes of non-sentient things are capable of being apprehended only by others, (and not by themselves). Non sentience means being without the possession of knowledge. To be capable of being apprehended only by others means that their apprehension is not to themselves or for their own benefit. These two (viz. being without the possession of knowledge and the apprehension not being for their own benefit) are true also of attributive knowledge (dharmabhūta jñāna), which is thus a non-sentient thing.

Of the three classes of non-sentient things, matter (Prakṛti) and time (Kala) are jaḍa (i.e.) not luminous by themselves. There are some who hold that Śuddha-sattvam is also jaḍa. To be jaḍa is to be without self-luminosity. Those who have studied such treatises as pañcarātra or the Lord's Śāstra would say that Śuddhasattvam is luminous by itself, as it is declared to be so in that śāstra. It may be asked why, if it is luminous by itself, it is not directly perceived by beings in the state of saṁsāra, without having to be known through śāstra only. The answer is as follows:- The soul whose essential nature (svarūpa) is knowledge and its attributive knowledge are both laminous by themselves and yet the former is luminous to itself and not to other souls, who have to know it with the help of their own attributive knowledge. Attributive knowledge, though luminous to its substrate, namely the soul, is not luminous to others. In the same way, the Śuddha sattvam may be luminous by itself only to Iśvara, the muktas and the nityas and not to others. There is nothing unreasonable in this view.

It has been said in the following śloka  :

“We [^f149] bow to Hari and proceed to expound the s'astra called Nyāya-Tattva :- to Hari who sees, directly by perception and of His own accord, all things simultaneously." It may be asked how, to Iśvara who sees all things with His attributive knowledge, Śuddha-sattvam could be[^35] luminous by itself, when it is illuminated by the attributive knowledge of Iśvara. The answer is as follows - Iśvara's attributive knowledge apprehends all things including His own divine svarūpa and yet do we not hold that His divine form is luminous by itself? So also it is possible that Śuddhasattvam is self-luminous, though it is apprehended also by the attributive knowledge of Iśvara. This is true also of nityas. When lighting up an object (like a pot), attributive knowledge, it has already been said, is luminous by itself only to its sub-strate, namely, the self or soul. In the same way Śuddha-sattvam may be luminous by itself to those that have attained release in their new state. There is nothing inconceivable in this. The luminosity of attributive knowledge is obstructed at the time when it is not light ing up external objects (like pots ), by past karma of certain kinds. So also the luminosity of Śuddhasattva may meet with obstruction in the state of bondage and may not, therefore, be apprehended by those in saṁsāra.

[^f149]: Nyāya-tatvam: Mangala śloka

[^35]: A pot is not luminous, because it becomes visible or is seen only when lighted up by the flame of a lamp. The flame of a lamp is luminous, because it does not require anything else to become visible.

</details>

The luminosity of (attributive) knowledge is natural to it (svabhavika), after release from saṁsāra, but is obstructed some times during bondage. So also in this case, (there may be obstruction during saṁsāra and luminousness after release)".

Substances which are subject to modification (vikarī) are sometimes agreeable and sometimes disagreeable to the same individual and to different individuals. (Similarly Śuddha-sattvam may be luminous to God, the eternally free souls and those souls that have attained release from bondage, while being non-luminous to those in bondage.) There is no contradiction in this. In matters ascertained by the authority of the Scriptures, it is no use pointing out inconsistency based on analogy. If, without accepting this principle, we were to say that Śuddhasattvam is said to be luminous not in reality, but by courtesy, as it were, or figuratively (upacāra), it might become possible to argue that knowledge, bliss etc. are also true of the self or soul only figuratively and not in truth. It may be asked :-" How could there be, in a luminous object (viz. s'uddhasattvam), qualities like form and taste and classifications like earth and water and also modifications. Self luminous things like the soul and attributive knowledge do not, in general, have shape, taste, smell and the like)"? The answer is as follows:- (All self-luminous objects are not alike but have differences peculiar to each); for example, knowledge or self which is the substrate (1.e. the soul) and attributive knowledge, though both are luminous, are different from each other in other respects. Knowledge, which is the substrate, has subjectivity, while attributive knowledge is objective, and apprehends objects. So this objection can be given a counter-check (pratibandhi) and cannot hold good in a matter where the authority of the śāstra  must be accepted. Śuddhasattvam, which is luminous, is included among the three classes of non-sentient things, because it has not the quality of sentience or being the knower. The activities (pravṛtti) of these three kinds of non-sentient things are of the nature of varied modifications (pariṇāma) in accordance with the will of Iśvara.

PRAKṚTI.

Among these, prakṛti or matter is, in its essential nature, possessed of three qualities or attributes. Prakṛti or matter is constantly subject to modification. When its three qualities sattvam, rajas and tamas are evenly balanced, there is dissolution or termination of the world (mahapralayam) and when these qualities are uneven in proportions, prakṛti undergoes modifications into mahat and the like. The region of matter which is not modified and the region which has become modified have been classified by the Śāstras into twenty-four tatvās or reals - prakṛti, mahut, ahankāra, tanınātras (five), the elements (bhūtas) (five) and the senses (eleven) - the senses of knowledge (five), the senses of action (five) and the mind (manas).

Sometimes they are spoken of as more than twenty-four or less than twenty-four in accordance with the terms or basis of classification. The subdivisions of each of these classes of tattvas or reals, and the deities (abhimāni devatās ) presiding over or representing each of them should be understood by those who are qualified for their respective meditation. What we are primarily concerned with here is their being different from the atmā or self. These may all be understood as weapons and ornaments of the Supreme Being, in the following way

The self or soul is the invaluable gem, (koustubha); prakṛti or matter is the mole on the Lord's body (Śrīvatsa); the tattva or real called mahat is His club; knowledge and ignorance (jñāna and ajñāna) are His sword and its sheath; the ahankāras are His bow and conch (tamasa ahankāra is the bow (sārnga ) and sātvika ahankāra the conch); the mind is His discus (chakra); the ten senses are arrows; the tanmātras and the bhūtas (the elements) form His vanamālā (vaijayanti) or garland of wild flowers; Garuḍa is the Veda and Śrī kṛṣṇa (Kannan) the object of description in the Veda, is endowed with these and protects all from the top of Hastigiri".

The distinctive features of each of these twenty-four reals' may be seen in their respective definitions. Of these the twenty three reals which are effects and modifications of prakṛti and also their effects and modifications differ from one another in their nature and these differences may be understood from a study of the purānas.

ESSENTIAL NATURE, ACTIVITY ETC. OF PRAKṚTI:

Śuddhasattvam[^f151]

[^f151]: Pāñcarātram

"Satvam or Śuddhasattvam illumines its own existence; it is different from the quality called sattvam" "The creator[^f152] is beyond tamas;' "It is different from[^f153] prakṛti and is revered by the gods". These and other passages declare the existence of a region (of s'uddha sattvam) beyond tamas. Therefore the passages which say[^f154] "It (Prakṛti) is eternal and has no limits and is beyond all measure. It is endless and incapable of being measured” should be understood as stating that moola prakṛti or matter is endless or infinite except for the region covered by the nitya vibhūti (the region of eternal glory).

[^f152]: Rāmāyaṇa: Yuddhakāṇḍa: 114-15

[^f153]: Jitanta Stotram: 2-21

[^f154]: Viṣṇupurāṇa: 2-7-25,26

The activity or pravṛtti of matter (or prakṛti) is to become modified with its three qualities duly balanced ( during pralaya), and with them as a given after creation (śrīshti), for the sake of the experience of souls bound in samsarā, and for their release from bondage and so also for the delectation or līlā of Iśvara. It also acts in various ways, having assumed the forms of the body and the senses. Owing to the qualities of rajas and tamas in it, it conceals the truths concerning the reals' (tattvas) and gives rise to false or erroneous knowledge. While existing for the experiences of the baddha during saṁsāra, it may also reveal the tattvas or 'reals. just as they are, when the quality of sattvam in it is developed and may help in the striving for mokṣa. All these contribute to the delectation or līlā of Iśvara.

Śuddhasattvam is, in its essential nature (svarūpa), the seat or abode of that sattvam which is unmixed with rajas and tamas. Its specific state in time or sthiti is eternal in the (permanent) halls and towers (of Vaikuṇṭha  ) and in the specific and permanent forms of Iśvara and the eternally free. It is not eternal but temporary in such things as the forms that come into existence out of a temporary desire of Iśvara, of the nityas and of the muktas. Its specific activity is to undergo modifications to suit their desires so as to serve as accessories for the enjoyment (Bhoga) of Iśvara, the śeṣī, and as instruments for the service to be rendered by the śeṣas.

TIME: Kāla.

Time or Kāla is, in its essential nature, non-sentient or non luminous and all-pervasive (vibhu). It is eternal because its continued existence ( sthiti) is not limited by time. Its activity consists in its being accessory to creation and the like by such divisions as kală (1/30 of muhūrta ), kāṣṭha (1/30 of kāla) and the like.

All these substances (dravya ) are, in their essential nature (svarūpa), eternal. Some of them are said to be temporary or transient, owing to their assuming a new state or condition (avastha), which justifies their being called by a new name. As new states similar to those which have perished follow each other in continuous succession, they are said to be eternal in the sense of a stream or current of water (retaining the same form, though the water at any time may be different ).

The essential nature (svarūpa), the existence in time (sthiti), and the activity (pravṛtti) of all these substances are dependent upon Iśvara, because they have no existence etc, apart from His existence and without His will or desire. Therefore it is due to Iśvara's will that all substances are, by their very nature, agreeable. From this it follows that to Iśvara, to the eternally free and to the released souls, they are all agreeable. To those bound in saṁsāra, however, they appear as disagreeable or as only slightly agreeable at different times and to different persons in accordance with the karma of those persons. Even to bound souls, the essential Nature of their own self or soul is always to be agreeable, as such is the will of Iśvara. It is indeed, because of this false identification with the self which is agreeable and also karma, that the body which is disagreeable appears agreeable to those who are ignorant. Since prakṛti and its modifications are harmful owing to karma, the man who desires release from bondage should abandon the attachment to them. To those that have attained mokṣa , however, these very things are agreeable and not to be rejected. All those things that are taken for one's own with the notion of 'I' and 'Mine' are harmful. They become agreeable, when a man has come to understand his real nature and to realise that these things exist for the purposes of the Lord. We will explain this matter at length when we come to speak of the perfect and complete enjoyment of (the bliss of ) Brahman.

IŚVARA :

The essential nature (svarūpa ) of Iśvara on whom depends the existence of all things is truth (satyam), knowledge (jñāna),infiniteness ( ananta ), bliss (ānanda ) and purity (amalatvam ) because of attributes like being truth, being knowledge, being infinite, being blissful and being pure. These attributes define His svarūpa or essential nature. This truth is brought out by the Alwars in the following passages: "Thou [^f155] art light that never becomes extinct and is not capable of being measured" (where His essential nature as Truth and knowledge is revealed as also His infiniteness ) " Thou that [^f156] art perfect knowledge and bliss" and “Thou [^f157] that envelopest all and art a Light greater than all other lights, being both knowledge and bliss" "He is the [^f158] Pure". In these and other ways the Alwars meditated on Him. His other qualities, along with His divine and auspicious form and such other things, are attributes of His essential nature ( svarūpa) already defined by those attributes. Among these qualities knowledge, strength, lordship, valour, energy, splendour-these six are associated with His nature as the Supreme Being. Goodness, spontaneous love, and the like are qualities that make him easily accessible to all. These qualities are, at all times, connected with His essential nature (svarūpa ). The statement that some of these qualities are associated with the Supreme Person (Para), some with vyūha and so forth is only to show what qualities the Lord of all reveals to those who are devoted to any of these manifestations of His. (It does not mean that the other qualities are absent in any of these forms). Just as in the respective vidyās of the Upaniṣads, we are to meditate on certain specified attributes of Brahman, so also certain specified attributes are to be meditated upon in connection with particular forms of the Lord as revealed in Pūñcarātra or the Scripture of the Lord. In the Para or Supreme Vāsudeva, all the six [^f159] qualities[^36] beginning with knowledge are to be thought of. The śāstras sometimes say that the vyuhas (or emanations ) are four  and in some places that they are three. where it is said that there are four vyūhas and that Vāsudeva is one of them, since there is no difference in the qualities to be meditated on between the Supreme Vāsudeva and the Vyūha Vāsudeva, it is tantamount to saying that there are three vyuhas. Those who hold that the vyūhas are three state their view briefly in the following śloka  :- "O Lord, Thy original form shone with these six attributes; then came three forms of Thine which had, each of them, a couple of these attributes." Their respective qualities and activities are epitomised in the following śloka  :-- "O, Sovereign of [^f160] Śrīraṅga! As the Supreme Vāsudeva (Para) endowed with all the six qualities, you are the object of blissful enjoyment for those that have attained mokṣa ; as Saṅkarṣaṇa being endowed with strength and knowledge, you destroy the Universe and also promulgate the śāstras; as Pradyumna being endowed with lordship and virility, you create the Universe and make Dharma prevail; as Aniruddha being endowed with splendour and the power to overcome others, you protect the world and teach the Truth. In this way you divide yourself."

The differences arising from planes like the waking state have been thus summarised :-"O Lord, [^37] of [^f162] those that meditate on Thee, some are like those in the waking state, some like those that dream in sleep, others like those that sleep without dreams, and others still are like those that have fallen into a swoon. (In the first group, the senses function, in the second the senses do not function, only the wind is active; in the third group even the wind does not function; they only breathe; in the fourth group even the breath is suspended). In the same way, O Lord, Thou art in four forms and dividest Thyself into four forms and art meditated upon with attributes and weapons suited to each."

[^f162]: Rangarajastavam: Uttarashatakam: 39

[^37]: This śloka cannot be understood without the account given in the Appendix.

The twelve forms that begin with Keśava are other forms derived from the vyūhas. (Bhagavān also manifests Himself as vibhavas.) These vibhavas are thirty odd forms like Padmanabha. Among them Avatars like Matsya and Kurma are specified in relation to some specific purpose. In these vibhavas or avatārs, Iśvara conceals those attributes of His which He wants to conceal and reveals those attributes which He wants to reveal to suit the special mission which He has undertaken in them. Among them, there are varied manifestations which are countless. So has it been said, "The [^f163] forms of Kṛṣṇa are innumerable", Other forms similarly derived from the vibhavas can also be seen in the śāstras. Sometimes the Lord enters into some jīvas with His own specific form and into others with His energy (śakti) and accomplishes wonderful things. These belong to another class of vibhavas. The forms of the Supreme Vāsudeva (Para), the Vyuhas and the Vibhavas assume the [^f164] forms[^38] of the images and enter into the shapes of images (installed in temples), for the sake of devotees as desired by them. This is arcāvatara: The Lord is (also) present in a subtle form in the hearts of all jīvas. This form is called Antaryāmi Avatāra, as meditation on this form has been prescribed as the means which enables those who wish to enter into the meditation of the Antaryāmin or the divine all-pervading svarūpa of the Lord. It has been said of this meditation: "Those [^f165] who have attained success in Ashtaṅga yoga and who are desirous of worshipping the one who dwells in the heart are fit to meditate on the one (i.e.) the form in which He dwells in the hearts of all." Therefore this One (Hārda) is spoken as Antaryāmi.

[^f163]: Pāñcarātra

[^f164]: Sātvatasamhita: 6-22 This is stated in the following passage: "He assumes a form similar to that of the image, enters into it, and remains there”.*

[^f165]: Sātvatasamhita: 2-7-8

[^38]: Sātvatasamhita: 6-22 This is stated in the following passage: "He assumes a form similar to that of the image, enters into it, and remains there”.

All these forms of incarnation are constituted of the substance called s'uddhasattvam and have no connection with karma or its fruits. They are therefore called pure creation (s'uddha śrīshti). These avatārs (vibhava, arcā and Hārda ) are all real; in them there is no contraction or abridgement of jñāna and the other attributes of Iśvara; the bodies of these avatārs are made of Śuddha-sattvam; the reason for these avatars is only the Lord's will; their time of manifestation is the time when dharma has to be safe-guarded; their purpose is the protection of the good and the like; those who meditate on these avatars with clear knowledge may attain mokṣa  at the end of this very life without any future birth, by their successful adoption of the right means suited to their competency and capacity. All these truths have. been explained by the Gitācharya in five śloka s beginning with:-

"Bahuni me [^f166] vyatītāni etc." Many are the births that I have gone through, just like you.”

[^f166]: Bhagavadgītā: IV 5

This meditation on the vibhavas (or avatārs) creates supreme faith or confidence (mahāvisvāsa) in the mind of the seeker after salvation who seeks prapatti as an independent means or upāya, by affording him a knowledge of the great qualities of the Lord who is sought as the refuge and this at the moment when he adopts prapatti as the means. So also the worship of Archāvatāra (the image) will lead easily to mokṣa. Bhagavān Śaunaka has said :-[^f167] " Having shaped a beautiful image of Viṣṇu  with a lovely face and lovely eyes, out of gold, silver and the like in a manner that would be pleasing, one should adore it, bow to it, sacrifice to it and meditate on it. By doing so, one would enter into that form which is none other than Brahman and will have all one's sins dispelled." The Alwars, too, very largely dwelt on this secret doctrine about the Lord's avatārs and the distinctive excellence of the avatars in the form of arcā or consecrated images and considered the Supreme Self (in Vaikuṇṭha  ) as their original cause.

[^f167]: Viṣṇudharma: 103-16

Iśvara, who is in these varied forms, creates, maintains and destroys all, is also the giver of mokṣa  and has such other activities. These activities of His are due to the overflow of His bliss or ānanda.

Lakṣmī

Iśvara is with His consort in all situations as stated in passages like : "Lakṣmī , the [^f168] mother of the world, is eternal and inseparable from Viṣṇu ." This may also be clearly understood from the writings of Parāśara and Parankusa (Nammāḻvār), who, for the help which they have rendered, have been spoken of by Aḷavandār with great regard in these terms: "I bow to the generous sage, Parāśara, who composed that gem of a purāṇa (Viṣṇupurāna), wherein he discloses, as they are in reality, the truths concerning cit, acit apd Iśvara, their distinctive nature, swarga, mokṣa  and the means of attaining them" and "I bow my head at the two feet of Nammāḻvār fragrant with vakula flowers, for they are, to all those who are connected with me, mother, father, wives, 8008 and all forms of wealth and lordship."

[^f168]: Viṣṇupurāṇa: 1-22-53

In this context, we have to understand a difference in their activities or division of labour, as it were ; for the Lord is concerned with the punishment (of the evildoer) and Lakṣmī  with pleading to Him for mercy on behalf of the sinner; the Mimāmsakas have declared that the object which is stated by analogy to have attributes similar to those of another object actually described must be different by that very circumstance[^39] from that other object. So in this case, as it has been stated by analogy or atides'a "Just[^f170] as Viṣṇu  is everywhere, so also is Lakṣmī , O, best of Brahmins", there should be a difference between Bhagavān and Lakṣmī . This difference should be understood as referring (here) only to the difference in their functions or activities. This is the conclusion arrived at in the following śloka  in Śrīgunaratnakosa; "Youth and other attributes are common to both of you; however the Lord has manly qualities, like independence, conquest of foes, firmness and the like; you have such feminine qualities as existing solely for the husband, compassion and forgiveness. Thus you two have taken diverse qualities." "It is impossible to understand the real nature of God", says Nammalvar in (1-3-6). So in a matter like this, vain assertion or insistence is not proper,

[^f170]: Viṣṇupurāṇa: 1-8-17

[^39]: Without requiring any other authority to prove it. The different activities shared by Lakṣmī  and Her Lord are determined by their own will and not by difference in the nature of the two.

As has been said: "Some make [^f171] weak cases appear strong." Although it is possible to prove whatever we please with the help of our proficiency in logical disputation, we submit to the Authority of the śāstras. Therefore we should understand clearly the truth concerning the Real or Tattva that rules and the reals or tattvas that are ruled, only in accordance with the pramāṇas. We need not try to know all things but should try to know what is exceedingly useful. In matters which are only of limited use, we need not be so curious to obtain knowledge. The pilot tries to know just as much about the (vast) ocean as  would enable him to steer the ship along the right path. Similarly we have to understand, necessarily, as much as has been said here. In order to obtain unshakable conviction (about these truths), more elaborate treatises may be studied.

[^f171]: Mahābhārata: Sabhaparva 39-5

OTHER CLASSIFICATIONS OF THE TATVAS

OR ‘REALS':

Here we have classified the Tattvas into three. So also some consider Iśvara 48 the only real or Tattva, because all other reals are His attributes. Some have classified the tattvas into two as follows: The ruler and the ruled; the self and the non-self; the means and the end (upāya and upeya ). Some classify what should be known into four : the Saviour and that which is to be saved; that which should be rejected and that which should be accepted. Others classify what should be known ander five heads as pointed out before and others into six. In the Rahasyaśāstras, what should be known is stated to be seven. To all those who think in those varied ways, there are respective advantages accruing to the strengthening of their knowledge and their daily observances.

What is said in the following śloka , is of course true: "A knowledge[^40] of the śāstras can be obtained only with the greatest difficulty. Further it may unsettle the mind. Therefore having obtained a knowledge of Hari from the teaching of the guru, a man should cease from all such activities." This does not mean that one should make no attempt to learn the śāstras. It only means that one should learn what is most important as quickly as possible and proceed at once to adopt the means learnt therefrom for attaining mokṣa , without spending too much time over elaborate treatises, which might cause delay in the adoption of the means. The man who has enough to eat without tilling the soil would never think of tilling it. So also without wasting time over what is unimportant, we should, as soon as possible, adopt the means prescribed for mokṣa ,

Our ancient ācāryas who gave as the essence of the Veda have, out of compassion (for us), taught us clearly all about the three wonderful and varied tattvas, cit, acit and Iśvara in order to remove,' from our minds, the cruel delusion in regard to the body arising from karma and the notion that we are independent (of the Lord).

By the addition of a point here and the omission of a point there, there are countless systems of thought, each appearing beautiful with fallacious arguments owing to the endless differences due to 'is' and 'is not'. These are indeed as numerous as the poems composed by the imagination of poets (some omitting an incident and others inventing an incident and so forth). Notwithstanding this, the unparalleled vision of the truth (about the tattvas) will make them all vanish at once into thin air. When the man is seen in reality, the delusion that he is an animal or a log of wood, sthāṇu vanishes at once. So also when, with the help of the pramāṇas, Puruṣottama is ascertained as the Supreme Deity, the delusion that Rudra (Sthāṇu) or any other is the Supreme Deity is at once dispelled.
