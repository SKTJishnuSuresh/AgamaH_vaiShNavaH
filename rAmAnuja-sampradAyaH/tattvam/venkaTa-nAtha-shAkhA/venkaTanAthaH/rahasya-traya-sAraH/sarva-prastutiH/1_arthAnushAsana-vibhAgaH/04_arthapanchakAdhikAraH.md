In the words Nārāyaṇa and in om, the relationship between Iśvara and the jīva is revealed as that between the soul and the body. Having taken this relationship as the foundation or basis of the Viśiṣṭādvaita system, some investigated the five truths that should be known to everyone who desires mokṣa . Others took this relationship also as one of the things to be known and hence spoke of the six things to be known. If it be asked what the five things are that should be understood by the seeker after mokṣa  along with the relationship itself, the answer is as follows: "The nature[^f54] of "the end to be attained ” vis. Brahman, the nature of the individual self who is the seeker of the attainment, the means of attainment (upāya), the fruit resulting from it and so also the hindrances to the attainment of Brahman - all the Vedas with their (elucidatory) itihāsās and purānās speak of these five,"

[^f54]: Harita samhita

BRAHMAN, THE END TO BE ATTAINED:

ITS SVARUPA:

Among these, the essential nature of Brahman, which is the object of attainment, is revealed in the first letter a in om and in the word 'Nārāyaṇa ' in Tirumantra and in the words Nārāyaṇa with the adjectives 'Śrīman' occurring in Dvayam and in the words 'me' and 'I' occurring in the Carama śloka . It is in this way that they should be considered. While doing so, one should think of His essential nature (svarūpa) as infinite jñāna and infinite bliss ever inseparable from His consort, Lakṣmī , who, in every form and in all situations, participates in all His actions. For there are many authoritative passages in support of this prescribed contemplation -

“The Lord of the [^f55] Universe is ever with Lakṣmī  in Vaikuṇṭha, the world beyond” (Here the reference is to the Supreme Lord (Para) in Vaikuṇṭha.)

[^f55]: Lingapurāṇa

“This [^f56] Nārāyaṇa  is always with Śrī-- Nārāyaṇa  whose abode is the ocean of milk. He has now come to the city of Madhura leaving His bed (Adiśeṣa)" (The reference is here to the Vyūha) “Thou[^f57] art the God Nārāyaṇa , the spouse of Śrī and hast the Chakra is Thy weapon and Thou art omnipresent". (The reference is to the Vibhava or avatāra.)

[^f56]: Harivamsa: 113-62

[^f57]: Rāmāyaṇa: Yuddhakāṇḍa 120-13,

“ Bhagavān has the [^f58] mole, ŚrīVatsa, on His chest and Śrī is with Him eternally." "Lakṣmī  is [^f59] ever inseparable from Viṣṇu ." "He (Lakṣmaṇa) [^f60] said as follows to Rāma in the presence of Sītā". (Here Śrī is indicated as purushakāra). "The renowned [^f61] Lakṣmaṇa spoke thus to Sītā and to Rāma who had the great vow (of protecting His suppliants)". (Here Śrī is indicated in the state of Her being the upāya). “This Sītā[^f62] is capable of protecting this host of Rākṣasis from (the anger of) Raghava." (Here and in the next passage, Śrī is indicated as the upāya) "I will be [^f63] your protector" ( Sītā's words to the Rākṣasis ). "You will [^f64] enjoy yourself on the slopes of the hills with Sītā and, whether you are asleep or awake, I will render service to you" (says Lakṣmaṇa): (Here is the prayer for the fruit, namely, kaiṅkarya ). "He is [^f65] seated on the serpent Ananta ( Śeṣa), along with her (Lakṣmī)”; “When [^f66] shall I become their eternal

[^f67]: Aḷavandār: Chatusshloki:

"When the Lord, [^f68] who is along with Śrī, is pleased by the service rendered to Him by the eternal Sūris who delight in that service."

[^f68]: Aḷavandār: Atmasiddhi

"I worship [^f69] Viṣṇu  with the inseparable Śrī; He is the sea of purity and bliss"

[^f69]: Rāmānuja: Vedāntasara

"The [^f70] beloved of Śrī, who is infinite and whose form is the unique abode of all auspicious qualities "

[^f70]: Rāmānuja: Vedāntdeepa

."In [^f71] Brahman, the abode of Śrī(Śrīnivasa), may my mind be ever centred "

[^f71]: Rāmānuja: Śrī Bhāṣyam

"The Lord of [^f72] Śrī, whose essential nature is opposed to all that is objectionable and faulty and who is possessed of auspicious qualities and is (at the same time) infinite jmāna and infinite bliss."

[^f72]: Rāmānuja Gita Bhashyam

"Thou[^f73] , the protector of the cowherds from the torrent of rain caused by Indra, and the Goddess Lakṣmī ."

[^f73]: Mudal Tiruvandadi: 86

" Thou art [^f74] ever with Lakṣmī  adorned with shining brace

“ Thou [^f77] and thy lotus-born Spouse should be pleased to accept the service of the three worlds."

[^f77]: Tiruvoymozhi: 9-2-3

"I will [^f78] not be parted (from Thee) even for a moment”, says Śrī and abides on Thy chest."

[^f78]: Tiruvoymozhi: 6-10-10

“ Thou [^f79] art all jñāna and bliss."

“ Thou [^f80] art the light that never goes out and art beyond all

limitations.”

BHAGAVĀN POSSESSES ALL AUSPICIOUS QUALITIES :

Bhagavān is to be thought of as being opposed to all that is faulty or objectionable ; for it has been said, “That [^f81] Supreme Goal, which is called Viṣṇu , is free from all imperfections." and "He is [^f82] greater than the great; in the Lord of the great and the low, there are no such things as pain." He is to be considered also as possessing all those qualities which are necessary for one who is the object of attainment and who is, likewise, the means of attainment. Many are the passages that speak of Bhagavān's qualities :

[^f81]: Viṣṇupurāṇa:  1-22-53

[^f82]: Viṣṇupurāṇa 6-5-85

Hear [^f83] now of a man (Śrī Rāma) possessed of these qualities".

[^f83]: Rāmāyaṇa Balakāṇḍa 1-7

“Him who [^f84] is possessed of these qualities."

[^f84]: Rāmāyaṇa Ayodhyakāṇḍa: 2-47

“ Him who is [^f85] the eldest (son) and who is possessed of all Noble qualities."

[^f85]: Rāmāyaṇa: Balakāṇḍa: 1-20

"Him who is [^f86] thus possessed of noble qualities"

[^f86]: Rāmāyaṇa: Ayodhyakāṇḍa: 11-31

" Rāma [^f87] shone with (all these) qualities."

[^f87]: Rāmāyaṇa: Ayodhyakāṇḍa: 2-47

“Him who [^f88] was possessed of such qualities and of irresistible valour."

[^f88]: Rāmāyaṇa: Ayodhyakāṇḍa: 1-34

" There are [^f89] many noble qualities, O King, in your son."

[^f89]: Rāmāyaṇa: Ayodhyakāṇḍa: 2-26

" [^f90] Benevolence, compassion, learning, integrity of character. control of the senses, control of the mind- these six qualities adorn Rāma, the best of men."

[^f90]: Ibid: 33-12

" He is [^f91] known to be earnest in the matter of dharma; He is affectionate to those that seek His protection."

[^f91]: Rāmāyaṇa: Sundarakāṇḍa: 21-20

"Thou art [^f92] capable of affording protection and art also the refuge of all. This is declared by the divine sages."

[^f92]: Rāmāyaṇa: Yuddhakāṇḍa: 121-18

“ Thou art [^f93] the tree in which the good find their resting place; and Thou art the supreme refuge of all those who are in distress.”

[^f93]: Rāmāyaṇa: Kishkindha kāṇḍa 15-19

" He is [^f94] the store-house of such qualities as splendour, strength, lordship, great wisdom, supreme valour and might."

[^f94]: Viṣṇupurāṇa: 6-5-85

Is [^f95] there anyone that can comprehend the qualities of Viṣṇu , who is the inner self of all beings?" "My [^f96] boy, just as the gems in the ocean are countless, the qualities of the Lord armed with Chakra are innumerable ; "

[^f95]: Brahmapurāṇa

[^f96]: Vamanapurāṇa 74-40

" His [^f97] qualities cannot be enumerated even in tens of thou. sands of years by even all the gods assembled together. If there be any man of pure mind anywhere, gifted with the period of life appointed for Brahma and if he be further endowed with a thousand mouths, he may be able, O best of gods, to enumerate one ten-thousandth fraction of Thy qualities or may not be able."

[^f97]: Mahābhārata: Karnaparva: 83-15

“Though Thy [^f98] qualities are infinite, yet six of them are foremost among them; even as the universe is borne within thy body, the other qualities too, are contained within them."

[^f98]:  ? ?

" It is [^f99] owing to the deficiency of arrows that the man who wishes to cover the sky desists and not owing to any deficiency in the space of the sky. (So also ) we fall back from the praise of Govinda, owing to our deficiency of intelligence and not owing to any deficiency in His qualities."

[^f99]: ? ?

“Thon hast [^f100] qualities which, being remembered, afflict me during Thy separation - me the great sinner."

[^f100]: Tiruvoymozhi: 8-1-8

"He has [^f101] noble qualities like bliss, which are limitless in extent."

[^f101]: Tiruvoymozhi 1-1-1

BHAGAVĀN HAS A DIVINE AND AUSPICIOUS FORM:

Bhagavān should be thought of, also, as having a transcendent, super sensuous (aprākrita), divine and auspicious form, which is the resting place (āsraya ) of the universe, for there are many passages which refer to this form of His.

"To Him [^f102] whose form ever remains the same -- "

[^f102]: Viṣṇupurāṇa: 1-2 -1

"He who [^f103] has faith in His form that is eternal and in His being the Supreme Deity - him Bhagavān approaches soon, O Pauṣkara."

[^f103]: Paushkara Saṁhitā

“Hari has [^f104] another form entirely different from all forms seen in the universe, in which all these saktīs abide."

[^f104]: Viṣṇupurāṇa: 6-7-70

"He [^f105] assumes by His will a form that is immense and that is pleasing."

[^f105]: Viṣṇupurāṇa: 6-5-84

“The body [^f106] of the Supreme Being is not constituted of the (five) elements."

[^f106]: Mahābhārata: Śāntiparva: 206-60

“His form [^f107] is not constituted of prakṛti or matter nor formed of flesh, lymph or bone."

[^f107]: Varāhapurāṇa: 31-40

" This form [^f108] has four arms, is supremely excellent, and is in Vaikuṇṭha  ."

[^f108]: Mahābhārata: mausalaparva: 5-34

"He has a [^f109] form resplendent like gold and capable of being seen by the mind as in a dream."

[^f109]: Manu Smr̥ti: 12-122

"In Thy [^f110] form, O Lord, I see the gods."

[^f110]: Bhagavadgītā: 11-13

"He has [^f111] a body on which rest weapons and ornaments."

[^f111]: Ibid: 11-15

"All this [^f112] universe is in His form as weapons and ornaments."

[^f112]: Rāmāyaṇa; Yuddhakāṇḍa: 114-25

“The [^f113] Supreme Being Armed with the conch, the chakra and the club is in the region beyond the universe of matter (tamas)"

[^f113]: Viṣṇupurāṇam: 1-22-32

From the Pāñcarātra śāstra  (Bhagavat śāstra), it is learnt that this form of the Lord is of five kinds (1) The Supreme (Para Vāsudeva ), (2) Vyūha (Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Aniruddha and Pradyumna), (3) Vibhava (avatārs like Rāma and Kṛṣṇa), (4) [^f114] Hārda[^25] and (5) arcā (images worshipped in temples).

[^f114]: Harda is an aprakrita form of the Lord present in the human heart, like the arcā in temples.*

[^25]: Harda is an aprakrita form of the Lord present in the human heart, like the arcā in temples

Details concerning them may be learnt from the Pāñcarātra śāstra  and from tradition. Bhagavān should also be considered as having endless glories or possessions (Vibhūti). For there are passages like the following which describe His vibhūtis

THE VIBHŪTIS OF BHAGAVĀN: LILÃ AND BHOGA:

"These [^f115] are the vibhūtis (glories) of Viṣṇu  (i. e.) Brahma, Manu and others, time and all beings. "

[^f115]: Viṣṇupurāṇa:

"He has, for [^f116] His abode, the region of eternal glory called Mahā vibhūti.

[^f116]: Viṣṇupurāṇa :5-1-50

" There is [^f117] no end, O mighty warrior, to my divine glories" (vibhūtis). These ideas are concisely expressed in the śloka  :

[^f117]: Bhagavadgītā: 10-40

“The [^f118] anda of the Universe and whatever else is found within that anda are His vibhūtis."

[^f118]: Aḷavandār Stotram: 17

These vibhūtis (possessions or glories) of God are of two kinds, sentient and non-sentient, and these again are of two kinds, some existing for His Līlā or sport and others for His enjoyment (bhoga). This division into things for play (līlā) and things for enjoyment (bhoga) is based on the difference in the rasa or delectation, though all  of them have agreeableness (or ānukulyam) in common. Bhagavān should be considered as being engaged in the work of the Universe merely for His play or sport (līlā), for it has been said as follows:

" From [^f119] whom is the origin etc. of this world"

[^f119]: Brahmasutras: 1-1-2

“All [^f120] this is Hari's play (or sport)."

[^f120]: Mahābhārata: Śāntiparva: 206-58

“ Of [^f121] Him who plays like a child"

[^f121]: Viṣṇupurāṇa: 1-2-18

“[^f122] Playing like a boy with his toys"

[^f122]: Mahābhārata: Sabhaparva: 40-78

"Thou [^f123] playest with Thy creatures, as if they were balls for

[^f123]: Viṣṇudharma

sport."

“ All  [^f124] this is merely for play (on the part of Brahman) as in the world (kings play with balls).

[^f124]: Brahmasutras: 2-1-33

[^f125] SUMMARY.[^26]

[^f125]: This summarises Prapya (i.c.) the object of attainment, viz. Brahman*

Thus Brahman, the object of attainment, is ever with Lakṣmī : He is infinite jñāna and infinite bliss, and is opposed to all that is imperfect and objectionable. He is possessed of countless auspicious qualities like wisdom and power. He has a celestial and transcendent form of auspicious nature. He has two vibhūtis (līlā and nitya ) which are His body; He has, for His play or sport (līlā), the work of creating the world, of maintaining and controlling it and the like.

[^26]: This summarises Prapya (i.c.) the object of attainment, viz. Brahman

THE NATURE OF THE INDIVIDUAL SELF:

Now for the individual self (Pratyak ātmā) which is to attain Brahman :

We should know that the individual self is in three categories : Baddha or those who are in the bondage of saṁsāra, Mukta, or those who have attained release from saṁsāra and Nitya or those who are eternally free from bondage. The seeker after salvation should also know the peculiar features which distinguish him as a seeker of the means of mukti, from other baddhas.

The baddhas (or the bound) are those caught up in the cycle of births and deaths owing to the stream of beginningless karma. They range from Brahma to the blade of grass and are called kṣetrajnāh. (Brahma, gods, men, beasts, trees, grass and so on ).

The muktās (or released souls) are those who, by adopting the means (upāya ) prescribed in the śāstras, have obtained the Lord's grace, permanently transcended the cycle of births and deaths, and have obtained unsurpassed bliss as a result of the unrestricted enjoyment of Bhagavān.

The nityās (the eternally free) are those whose knowledge has never undergone contraction and who are, in this respect, like Iśvara Himself. "They [^27] are", it has been said, " of the same age as the Lord, eternal and free from all trace of imperfections," They have never been in saṁsāra and are engaged in eternal service to the Lord e.g. Ananta (i.e.) Adiśeṣa, Garuḍa and Viṣvaksena.

[^27]: has never undergone contraction

The characteristic attributes common to all the three of them are being atomic (in size) (aṇ u) and being of the nature of knowledge (jñāna), bliss (ānanda), purity (amalatvam) and the like. They are all śeṣas to Bhagavān and are entirely subject to His will. One should also understand what is distinctive and peculiar to one as a mumukṣu or seeker after salvation. This has been (already) mentioned in the Introductory Chapter and will be described later on also.

The essential nature of the jīva who seeks attainment should be thought of, while considering the letter m in om and in namas or namo in Tirumantra, and in the part nāra of the word Nārāyaṇa, wherever it occurs in the aṣṭākṣara and the Dvayam, in the first person singular form " I seek refuge" prapadye in Dvayam, in the second person singular of the word " thyself" in "surrender thyself" (vraja) and in the word thee (tva) and in the sentence " despair not" in the caramaśloka .

THE MEANS OF ATTAINMENT.

We will describe at length the means of attainment (upāya) and its auxiliaries and also the nature of the fruit to be attained in their proper context later.

Among these two, the upāya or means of attainment is to be considered as indicated in Tirumantra in the word namas or namo and in the part ayana (resting place). in Nārāyanāya ; in Dvayam in the first part and in the Carama śloka in the first half.

THE FIVE THINGS TO BE KNOWN

THE GOAL OF ATTAINMENT.

The Nature of the fruit to be attained or enjoyed is mentioned in the dative or fourth case (i.e) in Nārāyaṇāya in the Tirumantra, in the word namah in the Dvaya, and in the carama śloka in the words "I will free thee from all sins."

THE HINDRANCE TO ATTAINMENT,

The hindrances to the attainment are the multitude of obstacles that stand in the way of our attaining mokṣa , such as ignorance (avidyā), karma and vāsana or impression left in the mind by karma in previous births,

The foremost of these hindrances is the punishment inflicted by Bhagavān for disobedience of His orders continually from time immemorial. This chastisement causes association with prakṛti or matter with its three qualities (sattva, rajas and tamas) and thereby contraction of knowledge. It brings about a connection between the soul on the one hand, and the body, the senses and the like which are specific modifications of matter (or prakṛti) on the other. Further it makes the jīva subject to the sway of the body and the senses. To quote the words of the Alwar, “With the strong ropes of my sins, Thou hast bound me tightly with the body, covered the sores within the body (like flesh, fat and blood) with the skin and let me walk away from Thee." "With [^f127] the body given by Thee at the time of creation, I have been wandering about to the satisfaction of the body." This chastisement often consists in placing the jīva in the body of animals which can have no knowledge of the Śāstras and cannot act in accordance with them. Even in births like those of men, it confounds the mind with the views of infidels and heretics and, even in the case of those who escape this, causes, through the concealing agency of the peacock feather of primal matter (moola-prakṛti) and its modifications, the bodies and the senses, (1) ignorance

[^f127]: Tiruvoymozhi: 3-2-1

of the truth and (2) erroneous knowledge and so also (3) subjection to sense-pleasures. As ŚrīRāmānuja says, "This [^f128] (association with matter) causes obscuration of a knowledge of the essential nature of Bhagavān and also false knowledge. Besides it makes the jīva think that this association is delightful." As a consequence of this, it induces the jīva to disobey His orders and do forbidden things for the sake of petty pleasures. To quote again the words of the Alwar: "Is it [^f129] right on Thy part to  confound my soul and excite my five senses by showing me, who am a sinner, all sorts of petty pleasures?" One act of disobedience leads to further acts of sin. Well has it been said, "Sin "committed again and again destroys wisdom and the man without wisdom begins further acts of a sinful nature." In consequence the Lord makes the jīva wander again and again through the cycle of life in the womb, birth, old age, death, and hell, as stated by Himself, "I throw them always into asuric births" By means of the scriptures of those who are actuated by rajas and tamas, which show the way to secure petty pleasures, the jīva is made to fall at the feet of petty deities who are themselves souls ( kṣetrajna) fettered with similar chains. “Those who are actuated by rajas" it has been declared, “worship Yakṣas and Rākṣasas ; and those who are actuated by tamas worship the spirits of the dead and elemental spirits ( Bhūtagana)". The jīva is deluded into considering himself as greatly benefited by the mean and gruesome enjoyments afforded by these deities in the same way as worms find pleasure in dirt and filth.

[^f128]: Sri Rāmānuja: Periya Gadyam

[^f129]: Tiruvoymozhi: 6-9-9

Even those who practise yoga are made to practise it in connection with petty deities or in the meditations of such inanimate things as [^f130] nāma[^28] being Brahman and are made to fall therefrom in the acquisition of minor results. Even those who are devoted to the soul or ātmā are made to meditate on their ātmā either in contact with matter or as separated from matter either as if it were Brahman or as the atma in its own essential nature. As the result of these four kinds of meditation, the jīva obtains petty enjoyments after which he falls back into saṁsāra. Even in the case of those who practise true meditation on Brahman, and who meditate primarily on their own selves as having Brahman for their inner self or who think primarily of Brahman who has for His body their own selves - even they may be detained by the state of kaivalya or the enjoyment of their own selves, by the attainment of the [^f131] eight kinds[^29] of siddhi, by the attainment of the status of the vasus, or by the entrance into the body of Brahma and the like. Their (temporary) lapse from the highest aim or goal of life (namely, the enjoyment of the bliss of Brahman) is like that of a prince, whose coronation day has been already fixed, casting eyes on the servant maids who attended on hini while in prison. They are made to linger fondly over the body and the senses which are the result of past karma and those that are related to the body (like relatives) and the enjoyments connected with them. In this way they become subject to other pleasures than the final goal. Thus there are many forms of hindrance in the way of the attainment of Bhagavān. When a well thirty-two steps wide has to be leaped over, it makes no difference whether the man falls at the very first step or at the thirty-second step. In the same way wherever or at whatever stage the hindrance occurs, the jīva has not transcended saṁsāra.

[^f130]:  In the Chandogya Upaniṣad VII chapter, it is stated as follows:- He who worships nama or names like rig veda, sama veda, Itihāsa and purāṇa as if they were Brahman will realise only very limited fruits such as can be reached with these names".*

[^f131]: The eight kinds of siddhi: Aṇimā (contraction of one's body to the size of an atom, mahima (assuming a huge form) Laghimā (making one's body light) Garimā (making the body heavy), vaśitvam (mastery over self), aiśvaryam (lordship) prāpti the power of obtaining whatever one wants and prākāmyam (perfect freedom of the will.)*

It is true the Gītā says that for those who practise karmayoga, the effort will never perish or be in vain. What has been built up will, of course, remain built up, as it were, of stone, But we cannot say when the fruit will be attained, whether at the end of a kalpa or of a manvantara or of a yuga. Even sages like Vasiṣṭa, who ever acted in such a manner as to please God, had to wait long. Those who acted against the will of God like Vritra and Kshatrabandhu attained mokṣa  without any such delay. So it is difficult to say which individuals have done meritorious deeds that would lead to mokṣa  without delay. Similarly it is difficult to state who have done bad deeds leading to divine chastisement causing delay.

SARAŅĀGATI THE ONLY MEANS OF GETTING RID OF

THESE HINDRANCES:

How can this chief hindrance which is of the nature of divine punishment resulting from disobedience of the Lord's commands and which is the root cause of this chain of suffering-how can this be removed? The author of Śrī Bhāṣya (Śrī Rāmānuja) has declared that the only remedy for this hindrance is to obtain the favour of the Lord and that this can be done only by Śaraṇāgati or self-surrender to the [^f132] Lord. This declaration is made by him, while commenting on the order in which the senses, the mind and the like have to be controlled as stated in Kaṭha Upaniṣad[^f133] .

[^f132]: Bhagavadgītā: 2-40

[^f133]: Śrī Bhāṣya: 1-4-1

All these hindrances to mokṣa  are to be understood in whatever is contrary to what is ordained in the three mysteries (mantras) (e. g. the feeling that the jīva is independent and acts for his own purposes which is opposed to the truths shown in the aṣṭākṣara), in the egoism, or sense of 'my' or 'mine' in the genitive mama in namah (na + mama) and also in the words ‘all thy sins' in the carama śloka . These have to be thought of, so that one may feel the suffering which lies in walking on the hot sands of saṁsāra and desire to hasten towards the path leading to bliss.

Those who know these five have declared them in order that I may not despair in mind and in order that the darkness of ignorance may not confound me- the five namely - the Lord of the lotus-born Lakṣmī , who stands as the one thing to be attained, the jīva who loves the lord and craves for His grace by seeking His feet, the means (or upāya) to be adopted by the jīva for the attainment, and the fruit resulting therefrom, as also the strong fetters of sin due to delusion or ignorance (which are hindrances).

That which is to be attained is the Supreme Brahman who is the śeṣī of all; I am also a fit person to attain Him; the attain. ment should come to me as inheritance due naturally to me as to the Sūris; alas, by ny egoism and the ignorance arising from it, I have lost it, but I have been taught that, by surrendering myself to the divine couple who are my śeṣīs, I can now attain it.
